court imposes right to be forgotten on google search results mario gianni knows just what it means when google doesnt forget in the past when he typed the name of the campground he owns los alfaques into the search engine he was confronted with images of disfigured bodies some 36 years ago a tanker truck exploded at the campground along the spanish coast killing 217 people thats not only bad for business    its inhuman says gianni who himself lost a relative in the tragedy it has taken him and his family years of painstaking work to reestablish the campground business three years ago gianni sued googles spanish subsidiary demanding that the company at least remove the most horrendous images from its search results his aim wasnt to try to erase historical facts from the internet    he just didnt want the images to show up as the first thing you got when you typed in the name of the campground google refused to even discuss the issue a judge at a court in tarragona rejected giannis case saying he would have to sue the company in california where its headquarters are located that would have been far too expensive the campground owner says like so many others before him he gave up his legal battle against the internet giant in the meantime the shocking images no longer show up in the search results much to his relief last tuesday the legal position changed and today a person like gianni has far better chances of prevailing against google without even having to take the company to court a victory over omnipotent internet companies the reason is a ruling by the european court of justice the european unions highest court the court ruled in favor of a spanish man who had sought the deletion of an auction notice of his repossessed home dating back to 1998 that appeared on the website of a large newspaper the court ruled that in normal cases the right to privacy outweighs the interests of others the ruling is being celebrated as a victory in europe    a victory over the omnipotence of american internet companies and a victory of the value placed by the people of the old world against the economization of the private sphere german economics minister sigmar gabriel celebrated the victory in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper stating europe stands for the opposite of this totalitarian idea of making every detail of human behavior human emotion and human thought an object of capitalistic commercial exploitation the reason behind such euphoric reactions may be the general impression growing in recent years that people have been handed over to the internet companies with little or no ability to assert their rights these companies collect and process data in an unbridled manner and earn billions of dollars in doing so no other company has been as successful at it as google it took only a handful of years for the california based search engine to become one of the worlds most powerful companies the name has since become synonymous with an internet economy that knows no rules except those of its own creation were afraid of google in germany 90 percent of all search requests are processed using googles sophisticated algorithms there is no other country in the world where fears of google are as widespread as they are here were afraid of google mathias dpfer the ceo of german media giant axel springer recently wrote in a letter published by the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung google knows more about every active digital citizen then george orwell would have dared to imagine in even his boldest visions last week joe kaeser the ceo of german multinational engineering giant siemens even spoke of a digital war in an interview with spiegel the final victor in this war will be the one who owns the data but the european court of justice has now ruled that data belongs first and foremost to the individual its decision means that under certain circumstances users can now demand that internet companies    including google and others    delete links to their data almost more important is that the justices ruled that google and other internet companies must also respect the laws of the countries in which they are operating a deep digital divide beween europe and the us but while attitudes over the ruling in europe may border on the ecstatic the comments coming out of the united states verge on the hysterical as evidenced so many times since the birth of the internet era the europeans and the americans often have polar opposite views of the same sets of facts indeed theres a deep digital divide between the old world and the new world when it comes to issues of internet privacy the europeans regard the right to privacy particularly highly whereas the americans consider freedom of expression to be paramount often enough it seems these two views are irreconcilable reactions to the ruling in the united states seem close to unanimous the incomprehension rejection and anger of the verdict could be felt not only in the silicon valley but also in the media and among politicians and intellectuals a storm of indignation seemed to be sparked on the editorial pages of newspapers on twitter and among television pundits over the decision in an editorial the new york times warned that the ruling could undermine press freedoms and free speech it added that it could leave europeans less informed finally it argued lawmakers should not create a right so powerful that it could limit press freedoms or allow individuals to demand that lawful information in a news archive be hidden wild speculation us commentators gloated that the european love of the right to privacy goes back to antiquated german and french laws permitting honor based dueling for nobles others speculated wildly that the ruling is blatant european revenge for the nsa scandal in the us freedom of expression anchored in the bill of rights is so highly valued that any suspected restriction is often immediately considered to be a fundamental attack on democracy privacy on the other hand plays a miniscule role in american legal philosophy thats one of the reasons silicon valley internet firms often consider the european fixation on data privacy to be absurd following the european court of justice ruling however silicon valley is going to have to start taking these concerns more seriously the question is what the ruling will mean in concrete terms    for google facebook and all the other data mining companies not to mention their users putting people at an unfair disadvantage in cologne germany lawyer christian solmecke says he has been contacted by a dozen people since the ruling who would like to have entries in google search results deleted they include a young man who won a reading competition in a special education class that was covered by a regional newspaper in fact he attended a school for students with special needs of all sorts not just those with disabilities as sad as it may be those who google his name today can easily find the old article which can be a severe disadvantage when he applies for jobs solmecke believes that the ruling will increase the likelihood that google will be forced to remove links like that from its search results the justices in luxembourg also made it clear in their ruling that the young man wont have to sue the newspaper to have the link removed in the past google refused to accommodate requests to delete links unless the individual had successfully sued the website in question but for websites based in the cayman islands or belize    and there are many    there is little legal recourse available although the justices argued that what is reported on an individual website does not necessarily violate the right to privacy the fact that google makes it possible for millions of users to find the page and to establish a more or less detailed profile of the data subject is liable to affect significantly the rights to privacy in other words what might be legal on an individual website could actually be deemed entirely illegal as a google search result a balancing act the luxembourg justices make clear that eu citizens have the right in principle to protect their private data it doesnt even have to be very sensitive information either data like a birthdate could fall under the category as could the naming of an employer a mention of the purchase of a house depending on the circumstances anyone who produces an issue legitimately worthy of protection can demand that such data be removed from search results nevertheless as michael bartsch an attorney specializing in it and data protection issues states the court has not provided carte blanche for deletion demands but instead seeks a balancing act the justices have found that the rights of individuals override the financial interests of the search engine companies and the interest of internet users potentially interested in having access to that information the justices call for a fair balance to be found    one that can also depend on the role played by the data subject in public life in those cases the publics interest in accessing that information might override privacy concerns in which case the search results could be retained the justices did not provide greater details about how that balance can be found in their ruling 
right to be forgotten on the web unworkable argue data watchdogs privacy groups calls for european citizens to have the right to be forgotten online are unrealistic and could damage the economy according to representatives from the information commissioners office 
tighten rules on ecs revolving door with us tech firms says ombudsman the european unions ombudsman is keen to tighten regulations on the revolving door between european political institutions and private companies including technology firms it is entirely legitimate for people to move from the public to the private sector but it is not legitimate if they use their inside information for the benefit of the company that is hiring them said emily oreilly at the web summit conference in dublin while there are regulations around people leaving jobs at the european commission and related agencies to work for private companies and the lobbying firms that they hire oreilly wants to improve the current legislation i am not convinced that it is monitored adequately or enforced adequately and i think really that the rules need to be tightened she said i make a business case for it you wouldnt let somebody come in off the street and hack your computer see your files and then walk out so you cant let the people in whose brains all that information is stored go out unconditionally at a time when the eu and the european court of justice ecj are having more of an impact on large us technology firms  from the recent overturning of safe harbour legislation to the much discussed right to be forgotten rules  oreilly said she understands the desire of tech firms to poach experts from the european bodies information is key to everything and if you have the inside information in relation to a particular regulation that is going to have an impact on the bottom line of your company then obviously youre going to try to get as much information as you can she said who has the most information people who are working in the commission theyre the ones who are proposing the legislation theyre the ones who are negotiating with council and parliament the ombudsman office will play a prominent role in the relationship between european bodies and us technology firms like google and facebook not directly in any investigations involving them but instead dealing with any complaints about the process of those investigations and ensuring that process  including the lobbying that goes on around it  is transparent i think in the last few years the global technology industry and particularly the us technology industry has woken up to the power of the european union  said oreilly she added that this is partly about the opportunity they see in europe a market of hundreds of millions of people that is largely untapped in terms of its digital economy and also because the commission and the ecj effectively legislate the industries she said oreilly went on to say that since the ecjs ruling on safe harbour a lot of people are scrabbling around in europe and the us to put together safe harbour part two but stressed that the priority of the ec remains building a healthy digital single economy for europe they are pushing on with net neutrality legislation moving to update the data protection law which was created in 1995 and theyre also basically trying to steer the european economy and the european tech economy in a manner where it can at least attempt to match the dominance of the us she said theres a big political play as well certain politicians in europe arent happy with the fact that google and some of the american players dominate the european market so much and part of the reason they do is there is an absence of harmonisation jean claude juncker ec president has said that the path to european economic success is paved with smartphones and tablets so they have a very keen sense of the importance of the digital economy and a very keen sense of how much europe is lagging behind the us 
how to ensure paper records comply with eus new data protection regulation at the end of last year the european parliament and council reached an agreement on the general data protection regulation gdpr proposed by the european commission the new rules which will come into force in early 2018 represent the greatest change to data protection legislation since the dawn of the internet they will affect any organization across the world that handles data of european origin according to information management and storage company iron mountain the reforms which aim to reflect the changing needs of the digital economy and champion the data privacy rights of the individual could prove difficult to apply to paper based information to help companies ensure their paper records dont fall foul of the regulations iron mountain has prepared the following guidance on some of the key components of the gdpr 1 make sure you can find the information you need before you can de identify or delete information you need to be able to find it the reforms will enshrine the consumers right to be forgotten in european law and businesses will need to respond to requests to delete personal information unfortunately while it may be easy to remove digital data from a record or database hard copies are far more difficult to amend iron mountain research shows that close to a quarter 22 percent of companies have no policy regarding paper filing and allow employees to decide what to do for themselves as a result in many organizations no single person or defined team has complete oversight of what information is stored where even when the information can be located there are the practical challenges of having to partially edit documents often by hand iron mountain advises organizations to identify the departments and functional areas most likely to create and store records containing personally identifiable information pii and to prioritize scanning and secure offsite storage for those records organizations should also implement and enforce a clear filing and identification system for all paper records with tags and metadata marked on box files and cartons with clearly defined access rights and accountabilities be aware that paper often leads a double or triple life clearly defined processes for managing information from creation to secure destruction may not be enough on their own paper can slip through the cracks of the strictest information classification and storage policies simply by being copied or printed and left lying around carelessly disposed of or even removed from a secure building the 2015 privacy and security enforcement tracker report from pwc reveals that many european data security incidents that result in a penalty stem from human error in the handling of paper documents consequently despite the best intentions of an organization to comply with a data deletion request employees may be keeping the data alive in a desk drawer or home office environment iron mountain advises companies to complement their information management policies and processes with regular employee training and communication that show staff how to manage information securely and support a business wide culture of information responsibility every employee should understand what constitutes private or confidential data and how to handle it 3 build privacy into your processes the gdpr wants privacy to be a forethought in how information is produced managed and disposed of for paper this will all be about information handling processes iron mountain advises that organizations should make it difficult if not impossible for unauthorized people to access or make copies of documents that carry personally identifiable information information storage retention and destruction processes should all be reviewed with privacy requirements in mind    and adapted where necessary 4 accept that some rules simply wont apply elements of the gdpr such as data portability will be difficult to apply to information stored only on paper in some cases this lack of applicability is an advantage for example demands for robust cyber security measures do not apply to paper because it cant be hacked there is a wealth of business advice available on how to prepare for the new legislation but its almost all focused on electronic data and it security    ignore paper at your peril advises gavin siggers director of professional services from iron mountain organizations continue to create and process paper documents carrying personal information many have accumulated vast paper archives stretching back decades this legacy will present problems for any organizations no longer sure what information they hold in the archive it is now more important than ever to know what you have know where it is and know how to get to it when you need it photo credit lisa s  shutterstock 
europe finally agrees tough new data protection rules late yesterday european institutions finally agreed the text of new data protection rules gdpr more than three years after new regulation was proposed the 28 member states of the european union will have two years to transpose the provisions of the gdpr into their national laws with the regulation set to come into force from 2018 there are still a few more stages in the process  although the parliament council and commission agreed the text yesterday theres a further confirmation vote tomorrow by the civil liberties committee and another vote by the european parliament as a whole in the new year  but the commissions aim of finalizing data protection reform in 2015 has been met vra jourov commissioner for justice consumers and gender equality dubbed the rules clear and fit for the digital age the current european data protection directive was adopted back in 1995 so updating the blocs rules to keep pace with seismic shifts in technology is the overarching aim here along with a parallel push to harmonize regulations across the region with the goal of creating a so called digital single market to simplify operations for businesses selling services in europe latest crunch report commenting on the agreement in a statement andrus ansip vp for the digital single market argued the gdpr will remove barriers and unlock opportunities he also tacitly rebutted critics of the new rules brussels has been host to a small army of lobbyists during the data protection directive negotiation process with the us government and tech giants such facebook and google actively seeking to water down proposals the digital future of europe can only be built on trust with solid common standards for data protection people can be sure they are in control of their personal information and they can enjoy all the services and opportunities of a digital single market we should not see privacy and data protection as holding back economic activities they are in fact an essential competitive advantage said ansip todays agreement builds a strong basis to help europe develop innovative digital services our next step is now to remove unjustified barriers which limit cross border data flow local practice and sometimes national law limiting storage and processing of certain data outside national territory so let us move ahead and build an open and thriving data economy in the eu  based on the highest data protection standards and without unjustified barriers he added dropping like a nuclear bomb into the midst of the data protection reform discussions were the 2013 snowden disclosures which revealed the extent of us government mass surveillance programs and detailed how intelligence agencies were tapping directly into consumer data held by commercial firms like facebook the fallout from those revelations acted as a counterweight to high level us lobbying against strengthening privacy protections the snowden disclosures also played a key role in convincing the european court of justice to strike down the fifteen year old safe harbor transatlantic data transfer agreement this fall ec officials are currently engaged in negotiations with their us counterparts to try to hammer out a new deal  with a deadline set for that of january 2016 if youre interested in geopolitical data protection politics these have been very interesting days indeed thats the backstory but whats incoming in the new gdpr its worth noting that the full text has not yet been published  update it has now been published here  but the general thrust is billed as strengthening individuals data protection rights giving europeans a greater say in how their data is used  as well as seeking to streamline some elements of compliance for businesses the new rules will apply to any companies who have customers in the region regardless of whether the company itself is based outside europe some key provisions in the gdpr include fines of up to 4 per cent of a companys global turnover for breaching data protection rules  which for big tech companies like google could result in fines that run to billions of dollars liability for data breaches extending to any data processors a data controller also uses  so also applying to any third party entities involved in processing data to provide a particular service with plenty of implications for cloud based business models enshrining a so called  right to be forgotten  in law so when an individual no longer wants their data to be processed by a company and provided that there are no legitimate grounds for retaining it the data must be deleted huge implications for digital marketing a requirement for companies to appoint a data protection officer if they process sensitive data on a large scale or collect info on many consumers with an exemption for smes if data processing is not their core business activity a requirement for companies and organizations to notify the relevant national supervisory authority of serious data breaches as soon as possible parental consent required for children to use social media with the specific age within a 13 to 16 year old bracket to be set by individual member states a one stop shop single supervisory authority for data protection complaints aimed at streamlining compliance for businesses a right to data portability for individuals to enable them to more easily transfer their personal data between services commenting in a statement green mep jan philipp albrecht who led the european parliaments negotiations said the regulation returns control over citizens personal data to citizens companies will not be allowed to divulge information that they have received for a particular purpose without the permission of the person concerned consumers will have to give their explicit consent to the use of their data as with any new law the devil will be in the interpretative detail around specific clauses and exemptions and with 28 member states all needing to interpret and transpose the regulation into their own national law there is inevitably going to be variation in how the gdpr is applied across the region so one thing is certain lawyers wont be short of work as businesses seek to understand how they are affected and what they need to do to ensure compliance  and avoid the risk of a

uk businesses dont understand eu data reforms ico finds related topics data privacy share article short of time print this page email article not one uk business out of 506 surveyed by the information commissioners office was able to describe accurately the european commissions ten proposed data protection reforms the european commission proposed the reforms to its data protection regime in january last year they include an obligation to notify authorities of a data breach and the creation of right for data subjects to demand their data is deleted  the right to be forgotten the ec itself claims that they will save the european economy 23 billion by harmonising the data protection rules in member states but the uks ministry of justice has estimated that they will cost uk businesses up to 320 million a year in order to gauge the expected economic impact of the reforms the ico commissioned research firm london economics to survey uk businesses however it found a low degree of understanding of the reforms and of the cost of data protection in general the survey found that most businesses 82 do not even know how much they currently spend on data protection it is not surprising then that 87 could not estimate what the impact of the reforms would be respondents were asked to describe the reforms as they understand them four out of ten had an inaccurate understanding of all ten reforms and not one fully understands every one a lack of understanding about the provisions in the ecs proposed general data protection regulation persists across business london economics wrote in its report information commissioner christopher graham said the findings call into doubt some of the assumptions being made by the ec in driving the reforms  wed urge the european commission to take on board what the report says and to refocus on the importance of developing legislation that delivers real protections for consumers without damaging business or hobbling regulators he said in a statement 
right to be forgotten is foreign concept in america the european ruling against google underscores how far apart european and american legal systems are when it comes to data privacy and liability europes top court thinks people should have much more control over what gets posted about them online ruling that google can be forced to scrub search results directing users to old or irrelevant content thats embarrassing to someone that so called right to be forgotten championed by the european court of justice doesnt exist in america under us law google enjoys quite a bit of leeway as to what it can choose to take down or leave up evan brown  an internet and technology lawyer in the chicago office of infolawgroup llp told law blog a lot of that protection flows from the first amendment the european courts assertion that google could be required to delete inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant data clashes with american speech rights other federal laws give google even more cushion most important is section 230 of the communications decency act  which shields internet service providers and search engines from lawsuits seeking to hold them liable for not screening content produced by other parties so if someone writes or records something that is considered defamatory a breach of contract or a violation of state privacy law google can hold up the law as a defense if it gets sued for linking to it congress passed the law in the wake of court rulings  most notably a new york court decision against now defunct online service prodigy  that said internet service providers could be held liable for defamatory online content created by someone else without the legal shield of section 230 says mr brown online companies in the early years of the internet would have found it much harder to attract private investment we wanted people to create these services that we now rely upon and are bringing tons of money into the useconomy meg ambrose  an assistant professor at georgetown university who teaches international technology policy told law blog section 230 doesnt cover all content google could be ordered to remove content or links to material that infringes on a copyright another unprotected category is speech integral to criminal conduct which encompasses child pornography or snuff films none of this means that google doesnt remove personal information from search results when somebody requests it companies like google have their own removal policies and sometimes decisions arent driven by legal threats but by public or customer relations under its policy  google says it will delete links to pages containing information that could make a user susceptible to specific harm like identity theft or financial fraud for example they might remove a link to a page that shows somebodys credit card bank account or social security number in many cases google refers individuals back to the person or entity that published that material if the publisher complies the information wont show up in googles search results google however says it wont delete results that link to official government websites ms ambrose said the european ruling could prompt a discussion in america about whether section 230 should be adjusted the statute has come under criticism from some legal professors university of maryland law professor danielle citron for example says the law should be changed to rein in anonymous online groups that threaten or harass vulnerable people  rolfe winkler contributed to this post 
one of the things that economists keep trying to tell everyone is that institutions really do matter prime among these being the rule of law its why dictatorships whether of the majority or of an individual never really work out all that well economically simply because the certainty of the rule of law gets swept away by the waves of enthusiasms for this or that this week were all appalled by inequality so we could get most laws through that would reduce inequality last week we were all concerned about the china trade deficit and who knows what it will be next whether an economy is capitalist or not the continued operation of that much more important part of a functioning economy the market does depend upon our having a knowable and relatively stable rule of law and this is at root what the current spat between googleentity and france over the right to be forgotten and privacy laws is really about this is a deep deep and extremely important economic question who gets to make the law in the us the current insistence by the french privacy regulator is that it is the french privacy regulator this is akin to the french government insisting that they should regulate the american minimum wage the american visa system its just not something that can be allowed this is one of those times when the us government really has to step in and make their case very clear indeed at one level it doesnt matter greatly what that case is we need certainty more than anything else at another level the actual answer is most important and that has to be that the american government is sovereign in america and it aint ever going to be any other way yes globalisation is excellent and the digital form of it is becoming ever more prevalent but the system just is not going to work if any and every government thinks they can pass laws which the whole world must obey the system will only work if sovereign nations are in fact sovereign within their own borders the specifics here seem not all that important but underneath it is that very large indeed issue the basic story  paris    frances data protection regulator has slapped a fine on alphabet incs google for not implementing europes right to be forgotten globally rejecting a compromise offered by the internet search giant and setting up a court battle over the rights scope the ruling itself is here in a decision handed down on march 10 2016 the restricted committee rules that the google search engine service represents a single processing operation and the different geographic extensions fr es com etc cannot be considered separate processing operations the company originally operated its service using the com extension then created extensions as time went by to provide a service adapted to each countrys national language this means that for people residing in france to effectively exercise their right to be delisted in accordance with the cjeus decision the delisting must be applied to the entire processing operation ie to all of the search engines extensions contrary to googles statements applying delisting to all of the extensions does not curtail freedom of expression insofar as it does not entail any deletion of content from the internet at a physical persons request it simply removes any links to website pages from the list of search results generated by running a search on the persons first name and surname these pages can still be accessed when the search is performed using other terms accordingly the cnil restricted committee pronounced a 100000 fine against google to unpack this france has various privacy rules as obviously so does the us as hulk hogan v gawker shows us the european union has a standard set of them too although it should be said that people are more or less strong in their implementations france is towards the strong end one implication of this is that people should be able to ask search engines to eliminate from their results things which people might wish to have eliminated on those privacy grounds say spent convictions merely embarrassing moments of their history personally im not sure about this at all but that is what the law says googles first implementation of this was that if someone in france made such a request they would delete it from the googlefr results this was considered not good enough and if were honest it probably wasnt libel law does not work this way for example imagine that the new york timesentity libels someone living in england should this be heard under english or american law currently it is prosecutable in whatever jurisdiction someone actually reads it so if someone in england reads the online nyt and sees that possible libel then that by english law can be prosecuted in england this is a very long running principle too it is the jurisdiction it is available in not the one it is printed in which matters if we apply this logic and we should both the us and uk being common law jurisdictions to privacy then the privacy rights should extend to all of the people in that country thus the correct answer is almost certainly googles most recent offer using ip blocking they will make sure or at least do their best to make sure that no one in france can see that link to that privacy blocked information on googlefrcoukcom and so on it is the location of the reader that matters the french have taken this one step further they are demanding the complete scrubbing of the result from all google indexes everywhere they are arguing that the french right to privacy in france must extend to what someone in california reads at which point of course they must be stopped for if every legal jurisdiction on the planet has the ability to determine what someone in california may read then that famed american free speech has just been dumped out the window hasnt it as an extreme example i can think of one third generation dictatorship where calling the current despot fat boy might get you executed by machine gun perhaps by having heavy artillery fired at you we really dont think that allowing fat boy to determine what americans may say or read is a good idea though if this basic principle is allowed it will entirely ruin the essential nature of the current legal set up that sovereign nations are indeed sovereign within their own borders meaning that its just fine for france to insist and google to acquiesce in what people in france may read or not but not for france to insist upon what the rest of the world outside france may read or see nor force google to obey french law on such matters the importance of this is not just about privacy nor speech of course the moment that any government can dictate the law in another jurisdiction then all of our economic certainty about what the law is flies out the window and as up at the top economies simply cannot be efficient in this manner sovereign nations must be sovereign inside their own boundaries otherwise we never can have different economic models different rules different ways of doing things in different places in one sense it doesnt really matter what the law is as long as it is consistent which with 196 jurisdictions being able to meddle in the other 195 is never going to be true but in another manner it matters hugely either we have a world of sovereign nations each able to organise their internal economy as they wish or we do not and one of the points about having that sovereignty is that we have a market a market in different ways of organising an economy we did this in the 20th century and something vaguely capitalist and vaguely free market was so obviously the winner over planned socialism that theres only a few teenagers and madmen like fat boy who still believe in that planned failure of socialism whether this will still be true in one or three centuries is another matter but well never know unless experimentation is allowed to continue which brings us to what must be done as regular readers will know im not a great fan of government action but here there is absolutely a role that the us government should take they need to tell the french that this is simply not going to happen they should to put it politely go boil their heads wind their necks in we are not going to extend french privacy law to what americans may or may not do and we should also not leave google to fight this alone uncle sam needs to tell the elysee french law is indeed sovereign in france and we support google in its suggestion that geo blocking be used to make sure that search engine results accord with it and we will regard it as a grave imposition upon american sovereignty if you try to impose that on google or any other companys search results outside the sovereign territory of france for there is no way this globalisation thing this thing which has enriched so many billions can operate if each and every sovereign nations starts to believe that its jurisdiction extends to

eu agrees draft text of pan european data privacy rules europe has taken a big step towards stronger pan european data privacy laws after agreeing the text of new reforms the agreement four years in the making comes after six months of trilogue negotiations between the european commission the european parliament and the council of the european union  in the last legislative session of the year controversial plans that could have seen those under 16 blocked from social media by the increase in age of digital consent were watered down in the final text the new data privacy laws comprise of the general data protection regulation gdpr which governs the use and privacy of eu citizens data and the data protection directive which governs the use of eu citizens data by law enforcement the new privacy regulations aim to create strong data protection law for europes 500 million citizens streamline legislation between the 28 member states pushing a digital single market and boost police and security cooperation it is set to replace the outdated patchwork of national rules that have only allowed for small fines in cases of violation jan philipp albrecht the parliaments chief negotiator said that the new laws would give regulators real means to clamp down on misconduct and that firms breaching eu data protection rules could be fined as much as 4 of annual turnover for global internet companies in particular this could amount to billions for eu citizens the regulations will clarify the laws around a right to be forgotten give them a right to know when their data has been hacked a right to transfer their data between providers and give easier access to their own data and transparency around how it is processed the draft text is expected to be approved in full by the full plenary and member states before it is passed into law once approved the rules would become official within a two year span albrecht said that under the rules companies will not be allowed to divulge information that they have received for a particular purpose without the permission of the person concerned consumers will have to give their explicit consent to the use of their data concerns addressed part of the gdpr governs the age of digital consent and whether it should be increased to 16 from 13 after a backlash from technology companies who would be forced to gain consent from a parent or guardian to process certain types of data of those under 16 and child protection bodies  an amendment to the text made 15 december which allows individual member states to lower the age of digital consent to 13 timothy kirkhope conservative mep said concerns have been listened to and the uks age of consent will not be forced to change digital european future andrus ansip vice president for the eu digital single market said the digital future of europe can only be built on trust with solid common standards for data protection people can be sure they are in control of their personal information vra jourov commissioner for justice consumers and gender equality said harmonised data protection rules for police and criminal justice authorities will ease law enforcement cooperation between member states based on mutual trust contributing to the european agenda for security the news was welcomed by many sophie int veld of the alde liberal group said this reform is a big leap forward the eu will now have the most extensive data protection laws in the world and will set global standards phil lee partner with law firm fieldfisher said this is the most significant development in data protection that europe possibly the world has seen over the past 20 years forget safe harbour and right to be forgotten  this is much much more significant the new regulations while strong on eu citizens data protection are intended not to hamper business and to encourage growth in the european data economy legislators say ansip said our next step is now to remove unjustified barriers which limit cross border data flow local practice and sometimes national law limiting storage and processing of certain data outside national territory 
harmonised data protection in an era where digital developments have crucially undermined the thin line between what is private and what is public data protection is meant to protect the individuals information from being used in an exploitive manner with this in mind the european institutions have reached an agreement on a general data protection regulation gdpr the free movement of persons throughout the eu has increased consumers exposure to several eu businesses overlapping national borders this has forced businesses to comply with fragmented and outdated data protection laws the new legislation converges much of the previous fragmentation precisely through the use of a regulation as a legal tool instead of a directive this ensures eu wide legislative harmonisation through the direct application of the new regulation into the national legislation of eu member states the new rules aim to make compliance with data protection law much easier simpler and more efficient due to the decreased compliance costs involved allowing businesses more leeway to increase their competitiveness moreover smes can grow and internationalise throughout the eu without the fear of having to handle different data protection standards when operating in different member states furthermore the new regulation introduces a one stop shop which is intended to be the first contact point for businesses and consumers it also aims at simplifying procedures and act as a centralised authority responsible for administering data protection in the eu the simplification of procedures are estimated to save a total of 23 billion per year in compliance costs according to the european commission consumers have also been empowered by the new regulation obtaining the right to be forgotten the right to access ones information as well as the way consent is provided while this constitutes additional costs to business we recognise the strong need to encourage consumers to have further trust in online services consumer confidence is paramount in stimulating growth in the digital economy the new rules aim to make compliance with data protection law much easier simpler and more efficient the discussions on the gdpr in european institutions were rather complex originally the european parliament recommended that almost all smes would have had to engage a data protection officer in order to ensure that they are in line with the new legislation however through intense negotiations a deal was reached ensuring that the engagement of a data protection officer is strictly restricted to those firms whose core operational activities consist of handling significant amounts of sensitive data firms whose core business activities do not consist of data processing will now be exempt from this obligation from a business point of view this was a very positive outcome and a decision that makes practical sense as part of its reinvigorated lobbying strategy the gdpr was also the malta business bureaus first attempt at targeted legislative lobbying in brussels with european legislators and actively contributed to the conclusions reached in the run up to the agreement the mbb met a large number of meps sitting on the civil liberties committee in the european parliament  the committee which has been dealing with the negotiations on the parliaments behalf while the mbb had always followed business related eu policies through its european partners this was the mbbs first shot at influencing legislators and it will certainly not be the last we have shown that it is indeed possible for organisations from small member states to play an active role in the eus legislative process rather than sit and wait for the outcome the mbb is currently active on other initiatives well underway in the areas of company law and e commerce emanating from the eus single market and digital single market strategies and has met 64 meps in the process we will remain committed to continue following sensitive issues that will affect maltese businesses and intervene where possible to ensure that enterprises continue benefitting from the eu single market through a fair level playing field and a competitive business environment mario spiteri is president of the malta business bureau 
uk wants right to be forgotten removed from draft data protection laws the european court of justice has backed the right to be forgotten the uk wants to remove the so called right to be forgotten from new european union eu data protection laws being drafted as controversy over the recent ruling continues to rumble on justice minister simon hughes speaking at the house of lords committee meeting on the right to be forgotten on wednesday said the government does not want it to remain given the problems it is creating the government is currently negotiating with our 27 partners to get a new law which is the new directive and we the uk would not want what is currently in the draft which is the right to be forgotten to remain we want it to be removed we think it is the wrong position he said i dont think as an individual and as a minister that we want the law to develop in the way that is implied by this judgment that you close down access to information in the eu which is open in the rest of the world the comments come after the european court of justice ruled that individuals do have the right for search results for specific terms to be removed from the search indexes of sites such as google and bing this has led to much debate with news outlets such as the bbc and the guardian affected by the ruling it remains to be seen whether the new data protection directive will make it into law as changes in the leadership of the european commission ec are currently on the cards with new commissioners due to take up their positions in october 2014 furthermore new meps are taking up their seats after mays elections and this could also stall or end the progress of the draft directive if they refuse to pass it through the parliament hughes comments are not the first time a justice minister has criticised the plans for new data protection laws with lord mcnally saying cross national uniform data protection and privacy laws will hurt rather than help the regions economy 
nominee for european digital job explains positions in hearing photo gnther oettinger the nominee to be the european unions next digital economy commissioner center answering questions from members of the european parliament on monday credit emmanuel dunandagence france presse  getty images gnther oettinger the nominee to be the european unions next digital economy commissioner would have a lot on his plate the tasks that would await him were outlined in a three hour hearing monday when members of the european parliament peppered mr oettinger a 61 year old german politician with questions about how he would manage the diverse challenges that he would inherit by taking up the position on nov 1 throughout the lengthy question and answer session mr oettinger emphasized that he wanted to create greater connections across the 28 member bloc and that more investment was needed by local companies if europe was to keep pace with other regions like the united states and asia we have to compete in the champions league and we dont do that at the moment said mr oettinger the current european energy commissioner in reference to the pan european soccer tournament that includes the likes of real madrid chelsea and bayern munich we need at least two or three global companies in every sector if we want to compete in the global market mr oettingers comments came as the other nominees for the european commission the executive arm of the european union also faced questions as part of a weeklong set of hearings held by the european parliament in wide ranging responses to questions that included some about european telecommunications consolidation and surveillance by the national security agency mr oettinger tried to balance industry demands for less regulation to promote investment with the politicians fears that individuals online data might be misused by local and international companies like google mr oettinger backed long awaited plans to create a single european market for electronic communications  called the connected continent proposals those plans include allowing potentially increased consolidation among europes current disparate telecommunications market in which many local carriers have struggled to invest in high speed mobile connections europe has many assets when it comes to the digital economy but we are lagging behind compared to the us mr oettinger told european politicians on monday adding that the new legislation should be completed by early next year the main investments must come from the private sector in a nod to european concerns over data protection the prospective european commissioner gave his support to stiffer rules currently under consideration that would provide europeans with a greater say over how their online data is used by the likes of google facebook and other internet giants many european politicians have voiced concerns that the current standards allow local data to be potentially misused by international companies though mr oettinger stressed that there were limits to how much information should be shared with non european jurisdictions consumers should know if their data is shared and where it has been passed on to he said mr oettinger backed limits on how much europeans must pay to use their cellphones when traveling in europe he also supported the principle known as the right to be forgotten in which people have the right to ask that links to information about themselves be removed from internet searches in may europes highest court said that search engines including google and microsofts bing have to provide this service to european customers and potentially to people further afield but while mr oettinger supported the principle he said there were limits if the information was deemed to be in the public interest its one of the things you simply have to live with he said another major challenge awaiting mr oettinger is legislation around so called net neutrality this year the european parliament voted to guarantee equal access to the internet for anyone looking to stream online content local telecommunications companies have argued that they should be able to charge extra for enhanced speed and access to their networks when asked where he stood on the issue mr oettinger said he supported both easy access to internet services and the right of companies to profit from their investments this tightrope walk during the three hour hearing highlighted the difficulties the prospective european commissioner would be likely to face in trying to foster investment in the continents economy while also protecting peoples online privacy we have to do everything we can so no one is disadvantaged on the net mr oettinger said he then added i dont want to burden the digital economy with too much red tape 
its also an understanding of how europe is different first while europe is certainly a big and rich market its is not a homogenous early adopter market like the us this means that the triple digit growth you are used to wont happen here there will be more friction in the beginning as you navigate the 28 submarkets of europe and its easy to get cold feet all too often i see companies open european offices hit some bumps in the road and decide to close international also please dont think that london is europe  or even the united kingdom as a nation yes its more comfortable and familiar in london but it will also give you a very wrong impression of the continent european business relies heavily on personal networks  a lot more than in the us also dont be too surprised if europeans invite you to the opera ive noticed that this comes as a shock to some silicon valley entrepreneurs who often dont have passports and have never travelled outside the us sadly you wont last year a high ranking us diplomat threatened a trade war with europe over the so called right to be forgotten if companies want to tap into the the european market they have to apply european standards thats european for bring it on she obviously wasnt bluffing the eu court of justice handed down a ruling last month which forces google to remove results for searches on individuals in the hours after the ruling went into effect google received more than 12000 right to be forgotten requests for tech companies this means that the european commission has the power to regulate the rules of the internet on a global scale and it isnt afraid to use it i see a lot of us companies who optimize their taxes to the extreme with the so called double irish with a dutch sandwich last year google chairman eric schmidt stepped on quite a few european toes when he insisted to bloomberg that he was very proud of the tax schemes which allowed it to funnel a good deal of its profits to tax havens this march france sent google a tax assessment  essentially a bill for  15 billion in back taxes it now wants to investigate whether some aggressive tax schemes constitute an illegal state aid dont ask for forgiveness  ask for permission somewhat related the silicon valley way of doing business is based on the idea that its better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission facebook twitter amazon and apple are also feeling the heat in this eu war on what the german economy minister called brutal information capitalism heres how you can avoid getting mixed up in this war understand that europeans place a much higher premium on consensus than the us when i was at ebay  the company eventually became very successful in europe partly because it learned how to navigate the eu how to build bridges and work from an understanding of european culture a relative newcomer like airbnb seems to have cracked this too the city of amsterdam recently created a new category of private rentals which allows residents to rent their homes to guests for limited amounts of time read next airbnb revamps its review system hosts and guests see feedback simultaneously review period cut to 14 days 
in europe big tech seen as invaders not innovators a salesman right assists a customer in an apple store in paris when the new iphone 6 went on sale there on sept 19 2014 photo christophe ena ap berlin  at home american tech giants like apple facebook and google are admired as innovators and job creators revered even iconic in europe though theyre increasingly portrayed as tax cheats copyright infringers and privacy violators their size and power viewed with suspicion and growing concern in fact its fighting words in europe these days over what is seen as a new type of american imperialism  digital when we fight for the respect of privacy and location of wealth including digital on national soil we defend the spirit in which we do not want to become a digital colony of global internet giants said french economics minister arnaud montebourg earlier this year that sentiment is echoed around europe couched in the words of freedom and self determination of digital destiny either we defend our freedom and change our policies or we become digitally hypnotized subjects of a digital rulership of internet monopolists german economics minister sigmar gabriel wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung  a leading german  this summer i nformation capitalism calls the entire market economy system into question europe will succeed in finding a solution to this problem as a result some of these companies are facing sanctions as regulators companies and individuals on the continent bring case after case against them and in some instances even speak about breaking them up while the tech giants have not gotten a free pass on competition and privacy issues in the us they run up against a higher degree of suspicion or even animosity in europe over the past year eu authorities have accused apple of exploiting tax loopholes and breaking anti competition laws german newspaper publishers have sued google and yahoo under copyright rules and facebook is awaiting a verdict from the european court of justice on whether it unlawfully shared information about european users with american authorities its latest battle here the approach in the eu toward this kind of internet monopoly capitalism is quite hostile said christian wey a competition expert at the university of dusseldorf germany it makes sense because a lot of business go downhill because for example of google and in the end politicians are sensitive to voters here google in particular is under the microscope especially after a european court of justice ruling in may allowed people the right to be forgotten  it requires google to delete links from search results if users request them to be removed tens of thousands have already applied some say that case illustrates one major trans atlantic clash  american business models hitting up against data protection laws  in europe privacy rights are paramount in the us freedom of speech extends to  internet service providers such as facebook and google said jan oster who specializes in communication law and information technology at the university of leiden in the netherlands europe takes a more balanced approach between freedom of speech and rights such as privacy or reputation facebook has long run into problems with european data protection regulators who want the social networking giant to be more transparent about what it does with its users data  it has been hauled into court a number of times in germany and in other european jurisdictions over this issue in the latest battle the european court of justice is due to rule on a case brought by a student group europe versus facebook that alleges the social network unlawfully transmitted its users personal data from facebook accounts to the us government under us laws the us companies have to do surveillance or they have to help the us government said max schrems founder of europe versus facebook under european law they are not allowed to do that  the eu has not been enforcing its own laws facebook and google deny such allegations accusing local politicians of playing on fears of the public following the scandal surrounding mass surveillance by the national security agency another area causing deep ire in europe is american companies aggressive push to win the best tax deals for themselves by jurisdiction shopping  a common practice in the usa where states compete to lure business with incentives the european commission on tuesday released documents explaining why it decided in june 2013 to open an investigation into whether apple received unfair tax breaks from ireland that could violate european anti competition rules the commission is also reportedly looking into a tax arrangement between amazon and luxembourg those probes reflect increasing scrutiny of tax avoidance schemes throughout the world not just in europe said emer traynor a spokeswoman for the european commissioner for taxation customs union anti fraud audit and statistics in brussels mismatches between member states tax systems and those of non eu countries such as the usa facilitate the type of aggressive tax avoidance strategies that we see today said traynor american companies doing business in the eu contacted by usa today declined to speak on the record about their dealings with european officials in private however tech executives said their companies tend to comply with eu demands because they want access to the continents market of 500 million well educated tech savvy consumers europe attracted 2 trillion in investment from us companies last year according to a study commissioned by the american chamber of commerce to the european union or amcham eu still one common grumble is that big european companies are never subject to the same spotlight as american ones in europe one difference is that firms like google are us based and this may have an influence even though it shouldnt said wey meanwhile yahoo told usa today in a statement that the company regularly talks to with european policymakers about the promotion of an innovation friendly business atmosphere in europe earlier this summer a select group of large german media outlets filed a claim against yahoo germany and google for copyright royalties for using headlines and a few sentences from the outlets websites its a test case in a long running battle to force search engines  a market americans dominate  to pay our team will continue to have an active role in discussions to ensure that eu copyright and antitrust laws make sense in the internet age said yahoo officials in an e mailed statement the company is fighting back yahoo germany filed a lawsuit against a 2013 amendment to the countrys copyright law with the german constitutional court in late july challenging a provision  known locally as the google tax  that could force news aggregators to pay for snippets of content still the overarching clash with europeans is actually over size  a conflict that was notable in a case involving microsoft that cost the tech giant dearly in 2004 after five years of investigation european regulators determined that the maker of windows had abused its dominant position in the pc operating system market and slapped the company with a nearly 800 million fine the decision shocked americans who took microsofts dominant role in pcs for granted now the companies that have succeeded microsoft at the forefront of the american tech industry are running into the same problems  especially google aside from the pending case for royalties german media outlets also filed a complaint with german antitrust authorities saying that google is so big they were forced to agree to allow their content to be aggregated or face a competitive disadvantage the complaint was dismissed but is likely to come up again say attorneys with a market share of more than 90 google clearly has a dominant position on the market for online search engines in germany said bernd delventhal spokesman for vg media an organization that represents copyright holders and is a party to the lawsuit he says google has abused that dominant position some officials agree the german justice and economic ministers have repeatedly talked about unbundling google because its size is threatening the health of the online marketplace and the public good they say eu regulators have also started a preliminary investigation into complaints over googles dominance in the mobile telecommunications market  specifically the android operating system  and whether it violates competition rules eu officials stressed that they arent unfairly targeting anyone companies from outside the eu are well aware that they must comply with eu rules if they are active in the eu said antoine colombani a spokesman for eu competition commissioner joaquin almunia in an e mail the commission enforces competition rules on all companies irrespective of the national flag they may carry eu rules allow corporations to possess a large or even dominant share of the market as long as they dont abuse their powerful positions but american companies have a tough time trying to balance their success and popularity among european consumers with that rule  in the face of activist governments its not unusual for governments to try to get a grip on issues like this  although it is new for the online world said ulrich wuermeling of latham  watkins in frankfurt who advises corporate clients including american companies on how to stay on the right side of german law europe especially france is much more of a region where governments take measures to regulate industries than in the us its a big difference in degree  the tools are there and used in us too some say that these companies run into trouble is a matter of culture some europeans out of principle shun companies like amazon because they view them as behemoths with unfair business practices putting the small shops out of business and exploiting the labor force others worry about the power of giants like google and facebook over their data and their lives one thing that explains the overall clash say some is a paradigm in which businesses acting solely with business interests in mind is viewed as strange even distasteful the european social model is more oriented towards general welfare than it is toward private enterprise said ben tonra head of the school of politics and international relations at university college dublin still some say europe wont gain from its antagonism toward the tech titans if they come off as too harsh eu regulators could send a signal to tech entrepreneurs that europe is willing to stifle innovation challenging the status quo analysts said we are wrong however to look at these companies in an antagonistic way said tonra we need to look at these companies as an opportunity not just in terms of their own direct employment within europe and the innovation they bring to europe these are companies which are redefining technology the use of technology it is a very negative and short sighted approach on the part of the european union to go after them read or share this story

eu justice commissioner slams google and right to be forgotten critics eu justice commissioner martine reicherts has slammed google and right to be forgotten naysayers claiming their arguments against the reform are wrong reicherts attacked critics of the reform during a speech in lyon france arguing that anti right to be forgotten groups are covertly working to poison businesses and citizens opinions with false information just as work on the data protection reform has picked up speed and urgency detractors are attempting to throw a new spanner in the works they are trying to use the recent ruling by the european court of justice ecj on the right to be forgotten to undermine our reform she said they have got it wrong and i will not let them abuse this crucial ruling to stop us from opening the digital single market for our companies and putting in place stronger protection for our citizens the right to be forgotten was approved by the european court of justice ecj in may and is due to be ratified later this year the law requires search firms to remove links to results that are outdated or unwanted by individuals the legislation has been met with hostility by both search engine providers such as google and microsoft and numerous political groups including the uk information commissioners office ico and the house of lords their arguments have suggested that the ruling puts too much responsibility on search engine providers and will have a negative impact on both freedom of speech and the european digital economy reicherts specifically criticised google arguing that its complaint is largely based on its desire to continue using customers data for financial gain without impediment search engines such as google and other affected companies complain loudly but they should remember this handling citizens personal data brings huge economic benefits to them it also brings responsibility these are two sides of the same coin you cannot have one without the other said reicherts she added that the legislation has also made it clear that the right to be forgotten does not offer criminals a blanket way to erase their shady pasts or censor the internet the court explicitly ruled that the right to be forgotten is not absolute but that it will always need to be balanced against other fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and the freedom of the media  which by the way are not absolute rights either reicherts said factors to be taken into account include the type of information in question its sensitivity for the individuals private life and the interest of the public in having access to that information the role which the person requesting the deletion plays in public life might also be relevant and after all this is about requests to remove irrelevant or outdated links rather than the content they lead to finally reicherts moved to dispel economic arguments against the legislation claiming it will actually spur growth in the european digital economy today businesses are faced with 28 different often conflicting national laws our regulation will establish a single pan european law for data protection one law not 28 this will make it simpler and cheaper for companies to do business in the eu especially for smaller companies and startups which will find it easier to break into new markets she noted reicherts comments come after a controversial ruling by us courts that government departments such as the national security agency nsa have the legal right to request data stored by us based cloud service providers regardless of the location of their data centres the us ruling has led to concerns that combined with the ecjs right to be forgotten legislation international firms may be caught between a rock and a hard place where they cannot meet both bodies regulatory requirements 
eu parliament overhauls internet data protection regulations the reform replaces a patchwork of rules introduced two decades ago at the dawn of the internet age and boosts efforts by the european commission the eu executive to build a single digital market for 500 million people under the rules national watchdogs will be empowered to fine firms up to 4 percent of their total worldwide annual turnover if they are found to have broken eu wide data protection rules these new laws will ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is upheld for all european citizens the commissions first vice president frans timmermans said after the vote in strasbourg france and they will help stimulate the digital single market in the eu by fostering trust in online services by consumers and certainty for businesses timmermans added the new rules which took four years to hammer out include guarantees on the so called right to be forgotten google and brussels have previously clashed over this right which allows citizens to require search engines to erase results involving them after a period of time the new rules also give citizens the right to transfer their data to another service provider and to know when their information has been hacked while privacy policies must be explained to them clearly they are also designed to smoothen cooperation among law enforcement authorities a measure made more urgent with the recent attacks by jihadists in brussels and paris they set minimum standards for police to handle data within each member state as well as regulate police transfers of data across borders this reform is a great success for the european parliament and a fierce european yes to strong consumer rights and competition in the digital age said jan philipp albrecht a greens mep who steered the legislation through parliament citizens will be able to decide for themselves which personal information they want to share albrecht added the regulation will also create clarity for businesses by establishing a single law across the eu the new law creates confidence legal certainty and fairer competition brussels is seeking to extend the eu single market to the digital era europe as a bloc is the worlds biggest economy but despite its 500 million potential consumers it largely remains a divided continent of 28 distinct economies especially when it comes to media and the internet member states will have two years to turn the reforms provisions into law 
google launches right to be forgotten online form if youre in europe and you want something taken off google then just fill in this form but not everyones happy about it google has just made it easier for people to remove unfavourable stories about themselves from its search results by launching a simple web form google which is mightily annoyed at having to do this was forced to offer people the right to ask for stories to stop appearing in its search results after an eu court of justice ruling earlier this month the court narrowly decided that irrelevant and outdated information on search engines should be removed if the person or company affected complains the landmark case came about after a lengthy battle from a spanish man who complained that a tiny auction notice of his repossessed home which originally appeared in a spanish newspaper could still be located via google and infringed his privacy to submit your request all you have to do is give over some personal details including photo id and the link about which youre complaining supportgooglecom the first is that even if stuff does get removed from googles search results this will only have any effect in europe so if youre googling in south america or africa youll be able to see all the redacted results it doesnt make much sense in a globally connected economy to restrict the internet in just one region secondly the system is open to abuse from people whove done something wrong the bbc found earlier this month that more than half the submissions for things to be removed from the uk were from convicted criminals including someone convicted of possessing child abuse images google co founder larry page went as far as to suggest that the ruling could be used a pr tool for oppressive regimes it will be used by other governments that arent as forward and progressive as europe to do bad things other people are going to pile on probablyfor reasons most europeans would find negative

the antipoverty target in the light of increasing household costs debate tams meszerics rapporteur  mr president i think the topic we are going to discuss at this early hour on the last day of our part session this week is very important first of all allow me to thank everybody who has contributed to the work especially the shadow rapporteurs who have been very helpful very flexible and very professional in working out a text which i believe can command a fairly large consensus in the house this was not very easy to achieve it was very important that the shadows put their work and their commitment into the whole topic although i am listed as the author i have to thank all my colleagues in my group and especially my advisers who helped considerably in putting together a text which has a chance of passing and which i hope will pass on the vote today we are not getting any closer to the 2020 anti poverty target we are actually by all important measurements further away from the 2020 anti poverty targets than when they were originally formulated this is only partly due to the financial crisis of 2008  after all we are in the ninth year after the crisis  so we have a basic structural problem the report is not on that but one of the key elements in this attempt to reduce poverty in the european union is related to basic resources household costs and household expenditure i believe that fundamentally energy and water are essential resources which are necessary for the survival of any household in the european union they are essential especially because we are more and more dependent individually and in groups on energy at the same time energy prices have been continually rising in the last almost half a decade which makes the problem more serious than we would have thought at the time when the anti poverty target was put together at the time when this was formulated there was a widespread consensus that poverty is a complex global phenomenon which requires complex global treatment so some of my colleagues with an honest conviction thought that selecting a particular type of poverty from the complex web of poverty might be a mistake i would like to defend the view that energy poverty or fuel poverty is one of the most important elements in this because it usually requires an upfront investment simple direct income support is not going to help those who are in this trap because it requires an upfront investment that is why what we are asking for primarily is to have a complex policy set which simultaneously attacks all the three elements of energy poverty one of them being insufficient income another being energy efficiency  basically the quality of the housing stock in much of europe eastern europe is significantly different in this respect to western europe in eastern europe we do not have a meaningful social housing system and that contributes to and exacerbates the problem finally i would like to mention that we believe that a winter disconnection moratorium on heating is a must nobody should die in europe because of not having heating available marianne thyssen member of the commission  mr president i would like to start by thanking the rapporteur mr meszerics for this very comprehensive report which confirms once again that poverty is a complex phenomenon with several causes such as the increasing household costs in europe i share your concerns about the rise in the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the european union between 2008 and 2013 the prolonged crisis exacerbated the existing social challenges poverty exclusion and inequality as a result instead of progressing we have drifted further away from the europe 2020 target for reducing poverty however there are now some signs of stabilisation and with concerted efforts we can still make real progress i take note of your recommendation to invest fully in the fight against poverty and social exclusion  social inclusion is of course what we want the commission has put social fairness at the core of our agenda and work has already started to deliver on this commitment i am convinced that it is only by ensuring that social considerations are better integrated in all of the european policy areas that we can truly achieve the social europe that we want i am glad that your report supports our commitment to ensuring a social triple a for the union the european pillar of social rights lies at the core of our efforts to achieve that social triple a the commission launched a wide ranging consultation on 8 march we are counting on you and on parliament to contribute to this discussion on the social values and rights that should underpin the social model in the 21st century the draft european pillar of social rights puts a strong focus on fighting poverty and social exclusion it sets out principles to ensure access to adequate social protection including minimum income social housing and activating and enabling benefits and services it emphasises the work life balance and family friendly policies such as childcare and longterm care greater prominence is also being given to social considerations in and during the whole european semester process we acknowledge the rapporteurs recommendation to carry out impact assessments of national minimum income schemes and we would like to stress that over the years the commission has provided policy guidance to the member states i would like to mention here the 2008 recommendation on active inclusion the 2013 social investment package and the various countryspecific recommendations addressed to several member states within the european semester process furthermore the commission is providing support to greece to help it phase in a guaranteed minimum income scheme in 2015 the commission finalised a pilot project aimed at developing a methodology for comparable reference budgets across the member states a second phase of this project will be launched later this year furthermore the commission has been funding the development of the european minimum income network i am glad that the report highlights the importance of skills i would like to stress that one of the most profound challenges we are facing and one of our key goals is to make sure that people in europe have skills for jobs  skills for jobs which will improve their life chances this will be at the core of the proposal that i will be presenting on a new skills agenda for europe i also take note of your call to hold a summit on poverty reduction over the last 15 years the commission has been helping to organise the european meetings of people experiencing poverty these annual gatherings aim to step up the participation of people experiencing poverty in policymaking processes at local national and eu level i can confirm that they facilitate exchanges and mutual learning stimulate joint projects and aim to assess different approaches to combating poverty in the light of experience on the ground they feed directly into the annual convention for inclusive growth to ensure that the voices of people experiencing poverty are heard they have also been tackling homelessness which you rightly mention in your report as an extreme form of social exclusion we are currently finalising an euwide study on housing evictions another study on costefficient housing policies will be ready by june this year we have launched a joint project with the oecd to build a housing database entry and we are working together with the mutual information system on social protection missoc and eurostat to further improve housing data a social experimentation peer review of housing first was hosted in march this year by belgium finally we take note of your recommendation to submit a communication on energy poverty as announced in the communication setting out a new deal for energy consumers the commission is exploring how to improve european union wide data collection and monitoring of energy poverty furthermore with the review of the energy efficiency directive and the energy performance of buildings directive the commission intends to focus on customer protection following up the analysis of the member states implementation of their national action plans for the protection of vulnerable energy consumers in conclusion i would like to stress once more that it is the commissions firm intention to steer the union more firmly towards social fairness this means that no one should be left behind this is a social political and economic imperative i therefore express our strong commitment to using all means at the unions disposal to fight poverty and social exclusion i am very grateful that this report is stimulating the debate and helping us to stay on the right path julie ward rapporteur for the opinion of the committee on womens rights and gender equality  mr president i would also like to thank my colleagues for our work together on this report which cuts across many issues and needs a holistic approach it is quite clear that we need fresh political ambition to eradicate poverty across europe and we must be absolutely clear that there is no way of alleviating poverty unless we also tackle gender inequality the financial crisis and subsequent austerity measures have had a disproportionate adverse effect on women  far more than men  causing a feminisation of poverty this report sets out how the european union must work to address the concerns of vulnerable women especially single mothers and caregivers and women suffering from multiple discriminations who are so often left behind because of government policy the report is another step in the eus history of advancing womens rights and gender equality and is particularly important in the light of austerity we need a european definition of energy poverty and we need it to include a gender perspective reflective of the fact that female headed households are more likely to be energy poor these are some of the many concrete targeted policies that we propose which also include investing in research into the causes of female homelessness to conclude the commission and national governments must include a strong gender pillar in all of their social policy demonstrating that the eu acts for its constituents and for social justice claude rolin au nom du groupe ppe  monsieur le prsident madame

dveloppement de lemploi et la garantie dun revenu permettant de vivre dcemment les objectifs deurope 2020 sont loin dtre atteints si lunion europenne veut mriter son triple a social il lui faut absolument inverser cette tendance il nous faut tre conscients du fait que les mnages pauvres sont particulirement impacts par diffrents types de cot cest le cas pour lnergie et le logement mais aussi

seora comisaria y por supuesto muchas gracias a todos los que han participado en la elaboracin de este informe en particular al ponente seor meszerics por este texto que podra marcar un hito en la lucha contra la pobreza un texto que ha reunido la voluntad de muchsimos grupos del parlamento sino la de todos ms all de sus ideologas alrededor de un problema que compartimos todos son inaceptables los niveles de pobreza que hay en este momento en una de las zonas ms ricas del mundo como es la unin europea es inaceptable lo cual nos lleva a algo que se afirma en este texto tienen que dar prioridad a la lucha contra la pobreza con respecto a muchas otras polticas porque es el fundamento mismo de la libertad y de la solidaridad y de los principios que fundan la unin europea que no tengamos pobres en nuestras sociedades el texto tiene bsicamente dos aspectos que ha visto muy bien la seora comisaria uno es la lucha por un mundo mejor de cara al futuro y hablamos de soluciones estructurales como la renta mnima de insercin la mejora del parque de viviendas una poltica de vivienda y todo eso est muy bien y creo que la comisin tiene que centrarse en ello pero permtanme que termine esta intervencin diciendo que la pobreza es una lacra de hoy en este momento y los pobres estn aqu hoy y por lo tanto en el texto tambin encontrarn toda una serie de medidas que no son econmicas que son sociales pueden ser incluso ayudas fiscales pero son tambin subvenciones son ayudas son beneficios sociales son un mejor salario social para combatir la pobreza de hoy aqu y ahora y ah podramos incluir tambin el trato diferente al sexo femenino hay que tomarse esto en serio aqu y ahora con medidas concretas y tienen que forzar a los estados miembros para que sean mucho ms

ksznm javi lpez sd   seor presidente los datos de pobreza son vergonzosos hoy en europa y ver cmo han aumentado durante los ltimos aos es absolutamente intolerable la pobreza no solo es una estadstica tiene un enorme impacto social econmico porque distorsiona la demanda y la economa un enorme impacto institucional porque desconecta de las instituciones a muchas personas pero tiene incluso impacto en la salud pblica porque mucha gente ve su esperanza de vida mermada ante esto nosotros tenemos la opcin de continuar haciendo polticas macroeconmicas que han ido en direccin contraria que han permitido que aumentara la pobreza durante estos aos o instaurar normas europeas que combatan y luchen contra la pobreza en que se encuentran uno de cada cuatro europeos en mi pas en espaa uno de cada tres e instaurar una herramienta un sistema de rentas mnimas europeas que proteja a los ciudadanos y que les asegure que ante cualquier problema o dificultad o cuando estn en desempleo van a tener la proteccin del conjunto del estado de las administraciones pblicas y de europa para garantizarles una vida digna el orador acepta responder a una pregunta formulada con arreglo al procedimiento de la tarjeta azul artculo 162 apartado 8 del reglamento marian harkin alde   mr president first of all i want to thank the rapporteur for his important report it is important because it highlights the fact that one in six europeans are either in poverty or at risk of poverty in ireland the figure is 16 but crucially the report points to concrete measures that can be taken to try to meet the eu 2020 anti poverty targets we are all aware that poorer households spend a higher proportion of their income on household costs whether accounted for by utilities or housing or energy or food than other households do therefore a minimum income that takes into account the economic and social circumstances in each member state and is based on a life cycle approach is in my opinion a safety net certain practical suggestions such as a winter heating disconnection moratorium the possibility of extending the fund for the most deprived and measures to reduce energy poverty such as micro loans for investing in energy efficiency are all important steps access to water and sanitation is a human right and privatisation of these services has had a negative effect on households finally i agree with the commissioner we need to upgrade our skills and invest in jobs and crucially decent work and decent jobs ivo vajgl alde  vpraanje postavljeno z dvigom modrega kartonka  spotovani kolega vi ste

monsieur le prsident lurgence des situations invivables pour des millions deuropens qui sont confronts  la prcarit nergtique dans des logements insalubres ou qui ne disposent pas de ressources stables doit nous alerter hlas les propositions avances ne sont pas  la hauteur de cette urgence qui exige que lon sattache aux priorits et  la misre de nos concitoyens plutt que daccueillir celle du monde entier sans en avoir les moyens ces propositions sont aussi mal fondes on nous parle des minorits comme des sujets vulnrables sur le mme plan que le handicap le veuvage ou la maladie choses cependant plus concrtes qui ont des cots rels mais de quelles minorits parlons nous aucune dfinition nest donne au risque de dvoyer lobjectif de la politique sociale protger les individus contre des risques sociaux on semble aussi stonner de la pauvret des parents isols la premire rponse est une protection financire mais le fait de dire par exemple que le travail est la seule manire de sortir de la pauvret pour les mres seules est un raisonnement profondment antisocial il faut permettre aux femmes de choisir entre la vie professionnelle et la vie de famille en instaurant par exemple un salaire parental noublions pas enfin que lclatement de la cellule familiale est une cause de pauvret et de dtresse sociale arrtons les politiques libertaires proposes par lidologie sociale librale qui anantit les solidarits naturelles cest la mme machine qui laisse les spculateurs trangers faire exploser le prix de limmobilier et qui ouvre les portes de leurope  des millions de clandestins sans que lon ait rduit la pauvret dans notre propre voisinage attaquons nous aux causes avant de grer les consquences elisabeth morin chartier ppe   monsieur le prsident 120 millions deuropens risquent de tomber dans la pauvret et 19 millions deuropens ne mangent pas  leur faim le premier outil que nous avons au niveau europen pour aider ces gens  sintgrer cest le fonds social europen qui permet lintgration professionnelle cest la raison pour laquelle madame la commissaire au moment de la rvision des politiques pluriannuelles  mi parcours je compte sur votre soutien pour que la part des fonds de cohsion rserve au profit du fonds social europen soit augmente et passe de 23   25  cest tout  fait essentiel cest la premire aide que lon puisse donner  tous ces gens qui risquent de tomber dans la pauvret le deuxime point consiste  sanctuariser 20  du fonds social europen pour aider les plus pauvres et les plus dmunis le troisime point veut que nous conservions le fonds daide aux plus dmunis parce que les chefs dtat et de gouvernement avaient tort de vouloir supprimer ces politiques europennes maria arena sd   monsieur le prsident lutter contre la pauvret cest avant tout faire en sorte que les europens ne tombent pas dans des situations de pauvret il me semble donc important de parler des politiques dgalit en matire de lutte contre la pauvret et plus particulirement des politiques de redistribution des richesses nous avons ici mme dans ce parlement travaill sur la question dune fiscalit plus juste dune lutte contre lvasion fiscale dune lutte contre lvitement fiscal qui permettrait davoir des budgets de ltat plus robustes des budgets de ltat plus robustes cela permet davoir des politiques de scurit sociale qui sont le meilleur rempart contre la pauvret quand on a une scurit sociale qui garantit une pension de qualit qui garantit des soins de sant de qualit qui garantit une ducation de qualit nous avons la garantie que les personnes ne tombent pas dans la pauvret malheureusement les politiques daustrit ont choisi loptique de la diminution des dpenses je pense que nous devons apprendre de nos erreurs et aller vers des politiques qui sont des politiques damlioration des recettes et donc dune fiscalit plus juste yana toom alde   mr president i would like to highlight the importance of one of the key recommendations of the report which concerns the winter heating disconnection moratorium in my native estonia winters are rather cold  minus 20 celsius is quite normal for us this year winter was even colder than usual however in the city of kohtla jrve the residents of several apartment buildings were left without heat due to debts due to the local utility company low temperatures also caused damage to central heating radiators and water pipes froze people in kohtla jrve were lucky because local authorities were able to offer them social housing this opportunity does not exist in practice in many estonian municipalities this is only one incident which has happened in estonia this year however similar incidents were reported in many other european countries the winter heating disconnection is often immoral but it may in many cases also lead to human rights violations  not only the right to housing but under some circumstances it may also violate the right to health and the right to life without doubt the moratorium will help us to save peoples lives health and property tania gonzlez peas guengl   seor presidente cuando 122 millones de personas de ciudadanos europeos viven en la pobreza o en riesgo de pobreza y exclusin social se pone en riesgo el proyecto europeo en s mismo los objetivos de la estrategia europa 2020 son muy ambiciosos y estn muy bien sobre el papel pero de poco sirven si como ocurre en la realidad las rdenes de europa son cada vez ms recortes y cada vez ms austeridad que son la causa de que se estn disparando la pobreza y la desigualdad es necesario poner freno a la espiral de pobreza que estn padeciendo tantos y tantas ciudadanas europeas garantizando por ejemplo que los hogares vulnerables tienen los insumos mnimos de gas electricidad y agua o tienen una renta garantizada suficiente para vivir para las necesidades de sus familias o con proyectos de economa verde que generen empleo como el aislamiento trmico de las viviendas y adems sean respetuosos con el medio ambiente si me dicen de dnde sacamos dinero para todas estas cosas les dir que el fraude y la evasin fiscal se llevan un billn de euros en europa y en el caso de mi pas en espaa suponen el 56  del producto interior bruto es

joint commitment to the fight against poverty and to making the europe 2020 social goals a reality on the ground the discussion has also highlighted the enormous toll that the crisis has had on our societies there are some signs of stabilisation and if we mobilise our energy we can still make real progress now more than ever we need to join forces and focus on the delivery of the strategy in a holistic way let me repeat that this commission has set itself a clear ambition a europe worthy of a social triple a this implies that social considerations have to be properly taken up across all policy domains it implies that the welfare of people in europe and the improvement of their everyday lives have to be at the heart of policy making and this is what we have set out to do the focus of the energy union on addressing energy poverty is a concrete way of delivering on this commitment it is clear that if we are to reach our ambitious social goals we cannot afford business as usual thinking we need a forward looking approach investing in the skills that people and businesses need we also need our social protection systems to be fair and adequate and to perform well  for men and women alike the european pillar of social rights reflects this approach adequate and sustainable social protection is one of the three major headings of this pillar minimum income schemes and access to housing as part of the social protection system have been included among the twenty policy domains as have gender equality and work life balance president juncker and i share the ambition of promoting and enriching the debate on these matters in your constituencies thank you very much and let us continue to cooperate tams meszerics rapporteur  mr president i would like to assure the commissioner that as long as the house passes this report she can count on my cooperation with her at any time on any elements of the question this was indeed a rich and thoughtful debate i regularly learn a lot in this house and this was one of those occasions i would like to thank everyone who contributed there is only one element that i would like to raise from the report which has not been directly addressed so far which is that on the energy poverty side we have a clear technical problem we do not have a common definition i would very much like the house to understand that without having a common definition with which we can compare the situation across the board we are not going to be able to tackle the problem seriously it is the necessary beginning of the long hard work that is needed on this i would say to my colleague from the efdd who may already have left that he might have been less surprised by the tone and the elements of this report had he been consulting his groups own shadow rapporteur who did not find elements of the text to be part of a communist manifesto i would also say to my colleague mrs morvai that we agree that austerity measures do contribute to poverty but such austerity measures are introduced and actually practised at member state level it is member state governments which are responsible for the austerity measures most of the time therefore much of the increase in poverty is also the responsibility of the member states governments thank you again for your contributions i hope that you will vote for the report in plenary vilija

menschen wieder in der lage sind ihr leben zu fhren wie sie es wnschen private sector and development short presentation nirj deva rapporteur  mr president my report on the private sector in development breaks new ground it provides a solution to the huge financial shortfalls in funding created by the development agenda for the next 15 years the success of the millennium development goals in the past 15 years has provided ample evidence of how to get it right in the next 15 years but one billion people still live on less than usd 125 per day and more than 800 million people do not have enough food to eat poverty is not eliminated by hand outs it is only wealth creation that ends poverty we have 15 years to fix that with the new 17 sustainable development goals announced at the united nations last year but how can we fund this lofty ambitions to end poverty in all its forms everywhere come with a huge price tag climate change mitigation alone will cost usd 250 billion the united nations conference on trade and development projects a funding gap  yes i repeat a funding gap  of usd 25 trillion for the sustainable development goals this is a staggering sum a sum that is beyond comprehension to our european taxpayers a sum that the already struggling european taxpayer cannot even begin to shoulder my report highlights that such a funding shortfall can be adequately met only if the private sector is involved in development not through more taxes but through partnership but first we have to end the tax fraud in developing countries which accounts for losses of nearly 1 trillion annually through illicit funding money that should stay in those countries is brought to europe and other offshore accounts and hidden away by the elite of those countries we have to make sure that those funds stay in those countries to be used for the development of those countries secondly we have to demand that the oecd members match their 1970 pledge of 07 of gni thirdly the sustainable development goals will require the drive the managerial skill and the commitment of our private sector partners for it is the private sector which creates 90 of jobs and income for poor people in developing countries alongside donors civil society and trade partners fourthly public private partnerships must mobilise long term  not short term  private finance and hold the private sector accountable to public sector tendering processes transparency and scrutiny so this report calls for the private sector to invest in building and running schools digging for wells and irrigating agriculture building running and maintaining hospitals and hospital services building owning and operating roads airports and harbours and setting up meat  fruit  and vegetable processing factories all of which will create jobs and wealth in the developing countries done in partnership with the public sector and pump primed by eu development assistance if we mean to offer the billion people still living in abject poverty the dignity of work and of earning a living wage then we must seize this opportunity before us now and get on with it i therefore commend this report to parliament and in doing so i want to thank my colleagues in the development committee from all the political groups who have assisted and supported me in this and i particularly thank ms ingrid russell my research assistant for doing all the hard work    ecr                                                                             o            panama papers                                                            heidi hautala vertsale   mr president it is very clear that there is a huge financing gap for development so in addition to official development assistance the private sector must be mobilised for development and solving global challenges i think that at best an environment which is conducive to the private sector and business is one where good governance accountability and transparency rules and which is predictable for all however i believe that when enterprises enter into the field of development they have to be practising due diligence so that they really understand the conditions on the ground that what they are doing has to be genuinely in favour of alleviating poverty addressing climate change and creating local livelihoods in a sustainable way and also respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and women etc i believe that if we come to this kind of communication between the private sector and other development actors we can really achieve something marianne thyssen member of the commission  mr president it is with pleasure that i welcome the report on the private sector and development it is a significant contribution to a full and coherent expression of the european unions institutions on the importance of the private sectors role in development the report reflects the priorities and challenges identified in the 2014 commission communication a stronger role of the private sector in achieving inclusive and sustainable growth in developing countries and in the council conclusions of june and december 2014 the main challenge in our cooperation with developing countries remains achieving inclusive and sustainable growth and creating decent jobs for example as it is expected that africas population will double by 2050 we need to help it create at least 400 million new jobs this requires sustainable investment to diversify our partners economies and link them to global value chains official development assistance is essential but not enough domestic resource mobilisation is key and we must also catalyse private funding flows the european union blending framework is a successful tool for achieving european union external policy objectives by leveraging public and private funds discussions in the eu platform for blending involving the european parliament include exchanges on the issue of private sector engagement in blending in this context mr president i expect that from the programmed resources for the 2014 2020 period eur 48 billion of eu grants could leverage at least eur 66 billion in investments from financial institutions and private investors in partner countries in sub saharan africa asia and latin america the commission remains committed to ensuring and enhancing the local ownership of blended projects by involving partner countries and regional organisations this strategy would be implemented also through innovative instruments such as electrify or agrify initiatives which have been developed to promote private sector investments in rural electrification and agriculture structured dialogue and multi stakeholder approaches with the private sector and civil society organisations are key elements in our strategy we need partnerships that encourage businesses to put sustainability at the core of their strategies and to promote innovative inclusive business models the commission will invest over eur 2 billion to support global private sector development and facilitate responsible and inclusive partner sector investment in development by 2020 the commission will implement this strategy through national and regional indicative programmes and through thematic programmes european economic diplomacy can help mobilise european investments with mutual benefits for the sending and receiving countries in terms of growth and jobs the necessary support would be needed to allow these investments also to take place in economically riskier and emerging parts of the world the intervention of the private sector is also crucial for the transformational objectives of the social development goals and the climate change commitments in this regard coordination with the eu member states and respect for the principle of subsidiarity are important elements of the commissions approach fully in line with the sdgs and the addis ababa action agenda the private sector is sending signals that it is ready to work with us to become a true financing and implementing partner in achieving sustainable growth in developing countries i urge you to help seize this opportunity pakistan in particular the attack in lahore jean lambert author  mr president i am speaking today in my capacity as chair of the delegation for countries of south asia and i want to add my condolences and those of the delegation to the families and loved ones of those killed in the recent atrocity in lahore designed to attack children and families on the easter public holiday and also condolences for other recent attacks we have been seeing an overall decrease in such attacks by violent extremists and have seen a more consistent and coordinated effort from the government and the army and it is essential that they work together we welcome the governments commitment to reform the education system and curriculum to engender a wider understanding of human rights and respect for diversity we welcome too the further commitments in terms of equality before the law and the promotion of human rights which of course will need a strong and fully independent human rights commission as well as the implementation of the conventions that the government has signed up to not least as part of the gsp agreement we also hope that we will see a reconsideration of the death penalty and its eventual abolition tunne kelam author  mr president we are worried about the continuing violence and acts of terror in pakistan a great and important country and partner of the eu the massacre on 27 march in lahore targeted christians but most of the victims were muslims our sympathy goes to them all however lahore is not an exception there are systemic violations of freedom of religion under which christians ahmadis shia hindus and others are suffering outbursts of hatred and violence against minorities often find justification in discriminatory laws it is especially crucial that we stabilise the situation of religious minorities by the revision of so called blasphemy laws the tragedy of asia bibi the only woman who has been sentenced to death under the blasphemy law is symbolic she has been waiting on death row for six years now therefore we call urgently on the pakistani authorities to ensure a swift delivery of justice in her case the situation of religious minorities is our shared concern and i also call on high representative mogherini to fully engage with the government of pakistan in its efforts to eradicate intolerance and terrorism charles tannock author  mr president for those belonging to religious minority communities in pakistan life can be very difficult this is true for the shias the ahmadis the hindus and especially christians the horrifying terrorist attack in lahore on easter day is sadly not an isolated incident and deserves our full condemnation in this house whilst it would be unfair to say that no action has been taken i do call today upon the pakistani government to do more to foster an atmosphere of tolerance and respect for all communities part of the problem is the apparent inability to confront pakistans deeply troubling legislation on religion such as the blasphemy laws and the hudood ordinances  laws that should be repealed as a matter of priority salman taseer the assassinated politician who called for the abolition of the blasphemy laws and paid with his life for doing so is much revered by many in pakistan but it is clear to me that the country is still infected by undercurrents of extremism we have debated religious extremism and intolerance in pakistan in this house on many occasions and i really hope now that there is the will in that country and its government for some change marie christine

pakistan you may belong to any religion caste or creed that has nothing to do with the state those are the founding principles of pakistan to which we refer in our resolution every person killed maimed or injured in these cowardly attacks in lahore is a pakistani if we seek to split them into categories in our resolutions we do a disservice to their memory states and actors who support terrorist networks should know slowly you are being exposed your operatives are and will be captured and eventually you will be exposed completely when terrorists attack be it in paris or peshawar in london or lahore or indeed in brussels they attack us all and we stand shoulder to shoulder as one to face them alberto cirio ppe   signora presidente onorevoli colleghi naturalmente mi volevo associare e ringraziare per tutti gli interventi in cui si  espressa una dura condanna al terrorismo credo anche per che sia necessario che dalleuropa arrivi un monito chiaro ossia che  necessario difendere i diritti umani non soltanto sulla carta ma anche nei fatti nel senso che si apprezzano naturalmente quelli che sono gli intendimenti del governo pachistano ma dallaltra parte noi ci attendiamo fatti concreti che dimostrino che il rispetto dei diritti umani non  solo unenunciazione di principio ma  un fatto di quotidianit nella vita del pakistan mi riferisco in questo caso non solo a quelle che sono le situazioni relative alle discriminazioni religiose ma anche a quelle etniche perch non dobbiamo dimenticare  io chiedo che leuropa anche su questo stia attenta  che ci sono situazioni come quella del belucistan dove  anche sulla base di molte indicazioni che ci arrivano da amnesty international  io credo leuropa debba vederci chiaro perch si tratta di verificare se davvero ci sono discriminazioni che non sono religiose ma etniche ma sempre discriminazioni sono gianluca buonanno enf   signor presidente onorevoli colleghi quello che  successo in pakistan il giorno di pasqua  un attentato come abbiamo visto di terrorismo islamico per ancora una volta in questaula tranne rari casi si ha paura di dire che  terrorismo islamico c gente che ammazza cristiani solo perch sono cristiani la stessa cosa succede in europa e leuropa cosa fa niente guarda sembra uno zombi che guarda in giro ma non fa niente ai grandi politici europei certamente non succeder mai niente perch i grandi politici europei non  che vanno nelle metropolitane non vanno negli aeroporti dove passano tutti i cittadini come siamo anche noi no loro hanno gli aerei privati funzionano in altre maniere e a loro non succede niente ma ai cittadini veri e propri che cosa pu succedere di tutto e di pi e noi cosa facciamo nulla leuropa non fa nulla se ne frega altamente i cristiani continuano ad essere colpiti e i terroristi islamici dovrebbero essere puniti anche con la pena di morte io lo ridico anche con la pena di morte michaela ojdrov ppe   j bych chtla ct kolegovi e jako evropsk

thyssen member of the commission  madam president the attack in lahore on easter sunday as in peshawar in december 2014 targeted children  the most vulnerable members of society the terrorists attacked the future of the country and its diversity the lahore attack aimed to kill members of the christian minority but it also killed many muslims the attack comes only two years after the deadly church bombings also in lahore my colleague federica mogherini the high representative in a statement extended her condolences to the families and friends of the victims and underlined our support to pakistan in its fight against terrorism and in the promotion of our shared values among which is diversity we call on pakistan to bring the perpetrators and instigators of these attacks to justice and to take firm action against the organisations that claim responsibility we are very worried about the rising levels of religious violence and intolerance in some parts of pakistan and we are closely monitoring these developments minorities in the country including religious minorities continue to suffer disproportionately and they are frequently targeted by extremist militants we call on the government to step up efforts to ensure the security of all members of religious minorities the 2016 gsp report underscores that the human rights situation remains very challenging we always raise human rights issues in our regular dialogue with pakistan and encourage authorities to address the challenges including those concerning the situation of minorities the european union regrets the lifting of the moratorium on the death penalty in pakistan and the large number of executions this has led to pakistan is now the third largest executor just yesterday four more prisoners convicted of murder were hanged the european union is opposed to capital punishment in all circumstances and has consistently called for its universal abolition the european union in all its contacts with pakistan continues to underline the importance of reintroducing the moratorium on executions and of complying with the minimum standards the european union is also supporting several projects to improve awareness and protection of human rights access to justice for vulnerable groups and to strengthen civil society organisations in pakistan the european union bilateral development cooperation for the period 2014 2020 for pakistan with a total amount of eur 635 million has human rights and good governance as one of the three focal sectors human rights violations remain widespread in the country despite some of the constructive initiatives underway pakistan has made some progress in strengthening the institutional framework for human rights including by establishing a national commission for human rights furthermore the government recently adopted an action plan to improve the human rights situation in pakistan the plan includes various measures notably the development of a national plan of action for the promotion and protection of the rights of minorities some action has also been taken to address the widespread problem of hate speech there have also been some advances on legislation to improve womens rights the european union has also been calling for comprehensive action against terrorism in full compliance with international law fundamental values and international human rights standards more emphasis will need to be put on the prevention of terrorism in particular in the areas of countering radicalisation recruitment and the financing of terrorism let me finally underline that the european union has been and remains a staunch supporter of democracy and reform in pakistan honduras situation of human rights defenders ryszard czarnecki autor  pani

despus del golpe de estado en honduras persiste la ausencia de garantas democrticas libertades fundamentales y respeto de los derechos humanos as como una alarmante falta de voluntad poltica para

not only for better protection of human rights defenders but also for regulation for corporate responsibility for human rights including the right of grievances when rights are violated the project has been implemented without thorough consultation with the areas indigenous lenca population a finnish development finance company finnfund is one of agua zarcas funders finnfund claims to have carried out a due diligence process but the question remains why was the project considered to need funding from finnish development cooperation funds it is good that finnfund along with several other funders has now decided to freeze agua zarcas funding for the time being possible continuation of the project should be treated with caution indeed more needs to be done to ensure that business in developing countries is carried on in a responsible way that respects human rights    ecr            22        23                            2009   zelaya                               berta cceres

onorevoli colleghi ci occupiamo qui dellhonduras ma agli stessi colleghi vorrei domandare ma perch leuropa fa affari con la cina quando la cina ne fa di tutti i colori e non  in democrazia perch abbiamo fatto nuovi accordi con liran dove addirittura impiccano gli omosessuali noi abbiamo tra laltro un sottosegretario italiano omosessuale che  andato adesso in iran a stringere le mani quindi fa lomosessuale in italia per prendere i soldi evidentemente per stare con la seggiola sotto il sedere e poi va in iran a stringere le mani a chi impicca gli omosessuali oppure larabia saudita per gli affari con loro li facciamo adesso ce la prendiamo con lhonduras che poi lonu ha detto che le elezioni le hanno fatte correttamente ma cosa centra lhonduras voi a seconda di dove si devono fare gli affari poi parlate di multinazionali ma se qua fuori  pieno di lobbisti delle multinazionali e voi ci andate a parlare tutti i santi giorni e poi dite che in honduras ci sono le multinazionali che devono fare le dighe ma siete ipocriti o cosa siete marianne thyssen member of the commission  madam president the european union was deeply saddened by the heinous killings in honduras of human rights defenders ms berta cceres mr nelson garcia and lgbti activist paolo barraza ms cceres was a prominent human rights defender as we all know and was very well known by the european union for her courageous commitment in defending the environment and the indigenous rights of the lenca community to which she belonged in an immediate reaction to these odious murders the european union has called for a thorough expedite and transparent investigation of the cases it is of the utmost importance to give strong signals that impunity for these assassinations of human rights defenders will not prevail the european union continues to monitor with great attention the dire situation of indigenous leaders members of the lgbti community journalists and justice officials who continue to be particularly affected by violations of human rights in the country precautionary measures granted by the inter american commission on human rights should be immediately implemented to avoid any further killings the situation also calls for an urgent implementation of the law to protect human rights defenders the european union has been very much involved in promoting this initiative through its development cooperation programmes which provided support for the drafting of the law the overall human rights situation in honduras remains characterised by widespread violence in which corruption and impunity play a considerable part to address this rapid progress should be made in the implementation of the recommendations issued in the universal periodic review carried out in 2015 the vast majority of which have been accepted by honduras the union also looks forward to the full operation of the office of the united nations human rights commissioner the european union has constantly advocated human rights and justice reforms in honduras and stands ready to work together with the honduran people to address these challenges the union and its member states are the most important actors in development cooperation including on human rights issues in the country the european union welcomes the recent agreement on the deployment of an organisation of american states mission to support the fight against corruption and impunity in honduras known as maccih in its spanish acronym and the request for support from the honduran authorities to this mission in the investigation of mrs berta cceress killing in broader terms the union has taken proactive steps to protect human rights defenders worldwide this includes the establishment at the end of 2015 of a comprehensive human rights defender mechanism managed by a consortium of human rights ngos which has now become fully operational francisco assis sd  por escrito  o ativismo em prol dos direitos

auteur  met zijn rijkdom aan grondstoffen zou nigeria een van de economische motoren van afrika kunnen zijn we hebben hier in dit halfrond nog de ambities van president buhari gehoord toen hij hier in februari zijn toespraak hield de realiteit is jammer genoeg anders er is geen voorspoed maar armoede milieuvervuiling corruptie conflicten en geweld de terreur van boko haram grootschalige schendingen van de mensenrechten de verschillende religieuze groepen   christenen n moslims   en de etnische minderheden zijn er het slachtoffer van ik ben alle collegas die hebben meegewerkt aan een uitstekende gezamenlijke resolutie dan ook heel dankbaar de nigeriaanse grondwet garandeert de vrijheid van mening en van godsdienst het is de plicht van de overheid om die rechten te respecteren en de burgers te beschermen ik roep de president dan ook op om een versnelling hoger te schakelen in de zoektocht naar de ontvoerde schoolmeisjes uit chibok het is vandaag twee jaar geleden dat terroristen van boko haram hen op brutale wijze wegrukten uit hun families deze kinderen horen thuis bij hun ouders op de schoolbanken en niet op het strijdveld van boko haram jean lambert author  madam president as previous speakers have said today is a day of reflection it is the second anniversary of the abductions of the schoolgirls from chibok and we are remembering them today along with many others who have suffered at the hands of boko haram and particularly the families of those whose fate is unknown in responding to this there is a great need for coordinated action both within the state of nigeria itself and within the region we know that there is real difficulty involved in deploying adequate state resources nigeria is a fossil fuel dependent economy in our view it needs transition planning urgently but prices have dropped we know that there is gross inequality within the country and there is an urgent need to tackle corruption in order to increase revenue furthermore to improve the quality of governance we need trusted institutions to tackle tensions confront violent extremism and increase the general quality of life for nigerians so we welcome the current governments efforts but we also want the eu member states and indeed our companies operating in nigeria to cooperate as well nigeria ist die grte volkswirtschaft afrikas und seine bevlkerungsreichste nation  ein schlsselland also  und darum ist es ganz besonders wichtig dass sich hier demokratie und rechtsstaatlichkeit entwickeln knnen wir haben vor wenigen monaten den prsidenten nigerias buhari bei uns hier im haus gehabt und er hat uns eindrucksvoll geschildert wohin er das land bringen mchte es gibt viele gefahren korruption ungleichheit sind weit verbreitet und das ist sehr ernst zu nehmen weil es das einfallstor bildet fr die terroristen von boko haram es ist immer noch nicht gelungen diese terrorgruppe zu stoppen zehntausende menschen wurden gettet millionen vertrieben und es ist besorgniserregend dass gerade in letzter zeit auch frauen und kinder als selbstmordattentter verwendet werden nigeria muss diesen kampf mit aller deutlichkeit fortsetzen muss hier ganz klare

president buharis inauguration in may 2015 the actions of armed fulani herdsmen led to the loss of around 500 lives in central nigeria according to christian solidarity worldwide despite advances in

president of the commissionhigh representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy my colleague federica mogherini held with the nigerian minister for foreign affairs on 15 march in brussels together they condemned the horrific abuses committed by boko haram and emphasised the importance of a comprehensive region wide approach with concrete actions in the political socio economic security environmental and humanitarian fields both parties also agreed that the fight against terrorism is a common challenge that can only be surmounted together when security forces abide strictly by international humanitarian law and respect human rights such a multi faceted strategy needs the backing of the international community and the european union is ready to support this effort this will be at the heart of the discussions at the next security summit in abuja in may at which the european union needs to be represented at the highest possible level at the ministerial dialogue federica mogherini also reiterated the european willingness to continue providing support to the population in order to help stop the violence and rebuild a prosperous future with our development assistance and humanitarian aid and with all other european instruments at our disposal we will assist the nigerian authorities in their endeavours to tackle the current challenges finally at the ministerial dialogue the high representative and the nigerian foreign minister also agreed to hold a dedicated human rights dialogue in abuja sometime in 2016 in which a broader agenda of topics will be addressed as you can see from what i have said the european union has been and will remain fully committed to pursuing its work with nigeria on all the issues that you have highlighted in this

voto positivo alla relazione sulla proposta di risoluzione sulla scorta delle seguenti considerazioni la protezione delle persone fisiche con riguardo al trattamento dei dati personali nonch la libera circolazione dei dati e quindi il connesso tema della privacy sotto forma di dato aggregato e dei sistemi utilizzati a loro difesa encryption impongono soluzioni a livello europeo se non mondiale questo pensiero  in linea con principi etici di attenta valutazione sulluso delle nuove tecnologie e con mia recente interrogazione sul pnr con la quale segnalo che lo stesso ha costi notevoli e richiede tempi lunghi per lattuazione che possono non corrispondere alle reali esigenze delle forze dellordine specie in emergenze terroristiche tristemente note va quindi richiesto un impulso europeo alla regolamentazione sullaccesso alle comunicazioni cifrate che devono essere rese fruibili senza creare vulnerabilit al sistema sia in mano pubblica che in mano privata  necessaria quindi riguardo il pacchetto protezione dati personali la creazione di un quadro giuridico chiaro sul loro utilizzo posto che una aggregata quantit di informazioni potrebbe violare la privacy e paradossalmente affinare tecniche terroristiche caterina chinnici sd  per iscritto  i dati di eurobarometro inerenti al 2015 ci mostrano che i cittadini europei sono particolarmente sensibili in merito alla divulgazione e al controllo online delle informazioni personali la protezione dei dati personali  un diritto fondamentale dellunione europea sancito nel trattato di lisbona va quindi tutelato con misure efficaci e al passo con i tempi per tale ragione la proposta della commissione di intervenire con due nuovi strumenti legislativi a tutela sia dei cittadini sia delle imprese va accolta con favore il regolamento generale sulla protezione dati garantendo innanzitutto una migliore informazione su quanto accade ai dati personali una volta condivisi contiene fra gli altri due punti particolarmente interessanti il cosiddetto diritto alloblio e let minima per lutilizzo di servizi in linea un insieme unico di regole che si applica alle imprese che offrono servizi online nellunione potr poi facilitare lo scambio di dati transfrontaliero e garantire una maggiore integrazione economica e sociale la nuova proposta di direttiva il primo strumento per armonizzare 28 diversi ordinamenti giuridici relativamente allo scambio di dati facilita loperato sia delle forze dellordine nazionali sia delle agenzie europee in un momento come quello attuale che richiede la maggiore cooperazione possibile pertanto ho votato a favore carlos coelho ppe  por escrito  no ano 2000 existiam cerca de quatrocentos milhes de utilizadores na internet hoje so mais de trs mil milhes nos

objetivos deste regulamento por um lado dar mais controlo ao consumidor sobre a sua informao e por outro lado estimular o mercado interno digital este regulamento garante sem dvida um maior respeito pelos direitos dos cidados mas no vai permitir dispensar um trabalho contnuo de sensibilizao e pedagogia como no vai impedir totalmente utilizaes indevidas de dados pessoais sem dvida que tambm vai

au parlement europen il tait indispensable afin de pouvoir lutter efficacement contre le terrorisme et la criminalit organise que ladoption de la directive concernant lutilisation des donnes des dossiers passagers soit couple avec ladoption dun paquet sur la protection des donnes  caractre personnel cest chose faite avec ce rglement pour lequel jai vot qui protgera les donnes des citoyens europens notamment face  lusage abusif qui peut en tre fait par les multinationales mais aussi par les gouvernements le texte protgera dsormais leurs vies prives notamment grce  une srie de normes parmi les plus leves au monde droit  leffacement voies de recours informations sur la faon dont les donnes sont traites encadrement des transferts de donnes des europens vers les pays tiers possibilits de profilage strictement limites ou encore sanctions en cas de non respect des rgles patrick le hyaric guengl  par crit  le nouveau cadre europen de protection des donnes personnelles doit donner aux citoyens davantage de contrle sur lutilisation de leurs donnes ce qui doit passer par leur assentiment par exemple par un message apparaissant sur un site et les avertissant que leurs donnes peuvent tre utilises et par la possibilit de revenir sur cet assentiment donc un droit  supprimer ces donnes cest ce quon appelle le droit  loubli tout transfert ou perte de donnes par une entreprise par exemple du fait dun piratage doit galement tre notifi enfin des amendes pouvant aller jusqu 4  du chiffre daffaires mondial seront possibles en cas de non respect des rgles ce qui peut tre colossal pour des entreprises comme google ou facebook jai donc soutenu ladoption de ces nouvelles rgles mais je regrette quelles aient servi de monnaie dchange aprs leur blocage pendant 4 ans

nanmoins de loccasion pour souligner les aspects positifs de cette rglementation qui va dans le sens dune protection amliore des donnes personnelles et donc de la vie prive des citoyens en france et en europe je citerai le droit daccs dune personne  ses donnes personnelles le droit  leffacement lorsquil sagit de donnes inexactes et le droit  loubli numrique qui protge notamment les enfants autre aspect positif les entreprises situes en dehors de lunion europenne mais proposant des services  lintrieur de celle ci seront soumises aux mmes rgles que les entreprises europennes il est important cependant que la france et les autres tats membres puissent apporter des accents propres en matire de protection des donnes personnelles antonio lpez istriz white ppe  por escrito  uno de los fines principales de la legislacin europea en este mbito consiste en defender el derecho fundamental a la proteccin de datos de igual manera tambin se pretende garantizar la libre circulacin de los mismos entre los estados miembros no obstante la rpida evolucin tecnolgica ha supuesto nuevos retos en esta materia es por ello por lo que esta recomendacin considera necesario establecer un marco ms slido y coherente en materia de proteccin de datos en la ue aquello que se pretende es lograr un desarrollo de la economa digital en el mercado interior que otorgue a los ciudadanos el control de sus propios datos y adems que se refuerce la seguridad jurdica y prctica de los operadores econmicos y las autoridades pblicas apoyo este informe ya que contribuir a formar una legislacin slida en materia de proteccin de datos y evitar el riesgo de que haya diferentes niveles de proteccin en los estados miembros louis joseph manscour sd  par crit  dbut 2012 la commission a propos un paquet de rformes comprenant dune part un rglement instituant un cadre gnral de lunion en matire de protection des donnes et dautre part une directive qui aborde le traitement des donnes personnelles  des fins de lutte contre la criminalit en renforant le droit dinformation des utilisateurs sur ce qui est fait avec leurs donnes ces deux textes vont permettre aux citoyens europens de mieux contrler leur vie prive et les rendre matres de leurs propres donnes en sassurant quils consentent  leur traitement et en leur garantissant des voies de recours contre toute utilisation abusive de leurs donnes grce  leur adoption les mesures prvues seront par ailleurs valables pour toutes les entreprises les entreprises trangres et notamment les gants de lconomie numrique qui souhaitent traiter les donnes de citoyens europens devront donc elles aussi se plier aux nouvelles exigences europennes ce paquet lgislatif permet donc de concilier un haut niveau de protection des citoyens et une loyaut renforce de la

il cittadino utente possa conoscere e decidere consapevolmente lutilizzo che viene fatto dei suoi dati questo voto mira a uniformare la politica europea di tutela della persona rimettendo al centro i suoi diritti anche in ambito digitale offrendo un quadro chiaro anche per le imprese dellue a beneficio della loro competitivit non vanno sottovalutate infatti le opportunit offerte alle imprese dal mercato digitale in funzione di una maggiore integrazione del mercato unico tali opportunit tuttavia potranno essere tali solo se sar garantito con esse anche il rispetto dei diritti dei cittadini remo sernagiotto ecr  per iscritto  ho votato a favore della presente relazione volta ad aggiornare la direttiva sulla protezione dei dati personali e a tutelare maggiormente le persone fisiche negli ultimi anni abbiamo assistito a uno sviluppo esponenziale della condivisione della raccolta e del flusso globale di dati le tecnologie attuali consentono infatti sia alle imprese private che alle autorit pubbliche di utilizzare dati personali come mai in precedenza nello svolgimento delle loro attivit e sempre pi spesso gli stessi privati rendono pubbliche sulla rete informazioni personali che li riguardano ci ha reso necessaria una regolamentazione pi moderna e uniforme a livello europeo per proteggere i cittadini il nuovo regolamento definisce i diritti delle persone fisiche come ad esempio la necessit del consenso al trattamento dei dati personali il diritto alla rettifica e alla cancellazione dei dati e un accesso facilitato ai propri dati personali vengono inoltre stabiliti gli obblighi generali di coloro che trattano i dati o ne sono responsabili tra questi lobbligo di attuare misure di sicurezza adeguate in funzione del rischio associato alle operazioni effettuate e di comunicare le violazioni di dati personali    ni         9546

indagine accertamento e perseguimento di reati o esecuzione di sanzioni penali in accordo con larticolo 8 della carta dei diritti fondamentali dellunione europea nonch con larticolo 16 del trattato sul funzionamento dellunione europea i quali sanciscono il diritto di ogni persona alla protezione dei dati personali che la riguardano  essenziale garantire un livello elevato e uniforme a livello europeo di protezione dei dati delle persone fisiche al contempo risulta tuttavia necessario al fine di garantire una maggiore sicurezza e prevenzione di illeciti facilitare lo scambio di dati personali tra i rispettivi servizi di intelligence nazionali in questo senso ritengo che la direttiva in questione raggiunga un buon equilibrio rispetto a queste due differenti esigenze garantendo il diritto alla riservatezza e al tempo stesso dando la possibilit alle forze di polizia di meglio contrastare e prevenire linsorgere di attivit illegali alberto cirio ppe  per iscritto  ho votato a

propus que fosse rejeitada esta proposta do registo comum de passageiros porque creio que ela nos converte a todos como suspeitos de terrorismo acredito mesmo que h um aproveitamento do medo que vivemos atualmente para nos retirar direitos e liberdades todas as autoridades tinham conhecimento dos suspeitos que acabaram por cometer atos terroristas no espao europeu em madrid os terroristas eram j conhecidos das autoridades francesas e britnicas em londres os terroristas eram seguidos pela polcia francesa no primeiro ataque em bruxelas o terrorista francs era conhecido pelas autoridades francesas no caso do charlie hebdo os terroristas eram conhecidos pelas autoridades inglesas no caso de bruxelas que agora recentemente vivemos as autoridades suecas tinham informao ou seja h informao sobre os suspeitos de terrorismo eles acabam por cometer os atentados no h troca de informao no h cooperao e com esta justificao acabamos por tornar nos todos suspeitos e guardar os registos dos voos

los datos que se almacenarn por lo que la polica podr recabar y almacenar informacin que no tiene por qu ser relevante para la inteligencia antiterrorista por ltimo se mantiene la posibilidad de transferir esos datos a un tercero incluso fuera de la unin europea lo cual resulta francamente preocupante y ahonda en la poltica de vigilancia masiva de la poblacin particularmente de activistas sociales por parte de nuestros gobiernos o de terceros pases con la complicidad de nuestros gobiernos por todo lo anterior hemos votado en contra louis aliot enf  par crit  je me suis fermement oppos au texte sur la cration dun pnr europen celui ci vise en effet  collecter les donnes personnelles de tout passager arien qui entre ou sort de lunion la position du front national est en effet trs claire ce projet reprsente une grave atteinte  la libert des voyageurs europens et se rvlerait inefficace dans le cadre de la lutte antiterroriste les attentats de paris et bruxelles par exemple nauraient pas pu tre vits avec un tel dispositif de plus certains comme le royaume uni craignent  juste titre que certains fonctionnaires dtat ne soient pas fiables et puissent divulguer des

should us have right to be forgotten the ability to disappear online is at the root of a european court decision that will require google and other internet companies to delete personal information about people on request the european courts decision to side with a spanish man who asked google to take down links to newspaper articles about his home being auctioned off due to unpaid taxes reverberated loudly in the us with tech companies immediately warning it would lead to censorship across the atlantic the ruling could open the door to forcing sites across the web to take down information at users request  even when it is true a us version of what europeans call the right to be forgotten seems impossible in this country both because of the first amendment which gives broad protections on what can be printed online and in paper and the quick and full throated pushback from technology companies at the center of the new american economy when it comes to children though there has been some effort on both a state and national level to limit what type of information gets collected and shown to advertisers and the world at large sens ed markey ed markey dem senators call for sanctions on congo honor frank lautenberg by protecting our kids sanders pans chemical safety reform deal more d mass and mark kirk mark kirk mcconnell ticket splitting will preserve gop senate majority moulitsas gop this is real life kaine murphy push extension of iran sanctions more r ill and reps joe barton r texas and bobby rush d ill introduced a bill last year that would create an eraser button for kids data on the internet in addition to expanding other privacy protections to children 15 and under the do not track kids act would allow parents and kids to delete publicly available information when technologically feasible i think that its important that parents have the right to be able to have information about their children erased markey said on wednesday i think that children have the right grow up and everyone realizes that someone whos 12 13 14 15 should have the right to things that they put up taken down the bill has 40 co sponsors in both chambers of congress and follows a similar effort in the states california last year passed a law creating a similar online eraser for people under 18 starting next year the law will require websites to let children and teens delete messages pictures comments and other activity online other states from new jersey to utah have considered following suit the ruling in europe could cut both ways for those efforts maybe it will provide an impetus for states to pass it said justin brookman the head of the consumer privacy project at the center for democracy and technology or maybe it will actually give incentive for companies to fight back those bills are limited to children and there seems to be little push to expand it to adults thats his primary focus ensuring that children are protected said debra johnson a spokeswoman for rush about the bill in congress as further legislation develops well see but at this time we will focus on children all individuals should be protected but children necessarily dont have the forethought of adults to ensure that what theyre posting will be looked at 20 years from now she added to some extent law in the us already does allow peoples information to be erased at a certain point under the fair credit reporting act for instance most unpaid debts and delinquencies are expunged from peoples credit reports after seven years juveniles arrested for minor crimes can have some of those records wiped clean once they turn adults going as far as europe would radically change the internet something unlikely in the country of its birth the eu decision gives any individual the power to become a censor of the web said ed black the head of the computer and communications industry association in a statement it could also create an uneven playing field for americans and europeans online if americans can see information that europeans cant we understand the desire to control information online but a more careful approach is needed to ensure this does not turn into the right to hide the truth from others  or the right to enforce ignorance on others added black whose trade group represents household names like google facebook microsoft and yahoo it has frightening far reaching implications for everything from researching information to free speech online he said for tech companies it also could mean lots of money and manpower that will have to be shifted to compliance they cant do it at scale theres no way said brookman theyd have to hire an insane amount of people he added i worry that they will say okay we got something just take it down because we cant deal with it and if we leave something up we might get sued  
scientists say eu data bill to harm research brussels   several of europes leading scientific institutes have warned that new eu data laws will hamper research in areas such as smoking related diseases or child nutrition they said in a joint letter to eu institutions this week the data protection bill goes too far in requiring personal consent for use of peoples information in socio economic studies if the amendments are passed there would be dire consequences for european research and the value it can bring to government the economy and society at large they said social science research has demonstrated the link between unemployment and health linked smoking in pregnancy to child birth weight and identified the long term socio economic benefits to children who are breastfed restricting the use of personal data for these and many other types of study would limit our ability to ensure european policy making is informed by the most robust evidence base they added that the new restrictions would stop scientists from maintaining contact with participants even if they have agreed to take part in studies and despite existing ethical approval and  confidentiality safeguards the amendments in question   on articles 81 and 83 of the bill   were introduced by the european parliament last year the law is now in the final stages of eu negotiations with the european commission predicting that it will be finalised before the end of the year but the main sticking point in talks is how to harmonise data protection oversight in eu capitals rather than the nitty gritty of data use for scientific purposes this weeks letter was signed by 28 scientists and sent out by science europe   a brussels based ngo the signatories include the directors of national research foundations in belgium the czech republic germany france ireland norway portugal slovakia slovenia and sweden the appeal comes after similar warnings from science bodies in the uk and other european states fell on deaf ears in the past 12 months the eu parliament has become europes main advocate for data protection in a political current fuelled in part by revelations of us abuse of peoples personal information in the name of counter terrorism the eu court in luxembourg earlier this year also struck a blow on the side of privacy in a ruling which forces internet firms to delete peoples personal information if they file a request the right to be forgotten verdict was at first welcomed by privacy campaigners but later attracted criticism when for instance convicted criminals used the new rules to whitewash their online identities 
does the right of erasure pose a bigger threat than the right to be forgotten following a recent european court ruling people can ask search engines such as google to remove results that relate to them photograph georges gobetafpgetty it is two months since the european court of justices ruling that google is a data processor under eu law  and the practical ramifications have begun to emerge last week search results relating to six articles in the guardian were deleted and then restored from european google domains the ruling clearly poses a threat to news dissemination in europe if not freedom of expression but the potential effect of the impending general data protection regulation could be much more far reaching according to dr fred logue an irish solicitor specialising in intellectual property rights and technology no new right has actually been established its just that the scope of an existing right has been interpreted i think the people who are using the phrase  right to be forgotten  are trying to frame a much stronger right being proposed with the general data protection regulation passed by the european parliament in march the regulation currently resides with the council of europe it is intended to harmonise and update the existing european data protection regime and it is due to become law in early 2015 but while welcoming such reform dr logue believes it could be quite dangerous as presently drafted the new articles 17 and 19 provide for erasure if one of four grounds applies unless an exception applies this codification of grounds is new and quite broad but its in the relationship between data controllers and third parties that the regulation really departs from the existing directive under the proposed article 172 the controller is required to inform third parties which are processing such data that an erasure request has been made and if the controller has authorised a third party to publish such personal data the controller remains responsible says logue to me this looks like a means designed to ensure personal data is erased widely from the internet if it is caught by article 17 notably the european parliament watered down the commission proposal for this clause there is also likely to be an economic impact on a range of companies arising out of the ecj judgement suggests logue paragraph 28 refers to automatically constantly and systematically searching information so companies that mine or aggregate data and sell some kind of information derived from it are at risk thats what google does it aggregates the data and sells advertising space based on the search results i would be very surprised if the ruling didnt have implications for twitter and others logue says that because the court ruled that even where theres a prejudice to the economic interest of the company it still has to comply there are likely to be costs involved and many companies will have to retain legal advice as google has done but paul nemitz director of fundamental rights and union citizenship at the european commissions directorate general for justice the section of the justice department that will oversee the legislations implementation doesnt agree with this assessment the right of erasure does not pose a threat to freedom of expression in europe a fair balance should be sought between the legitimate interest of internet users and the data subjects fundamental rights in particular the right to privacy and the right to personal data this may depend on the nature of the information in question and its sensitivity for the citizens private life and on the interest of the public in having that information finding the right balance is exactly the spirit of the on going eu data protection reform empowering citizens to manage their personal data while explicitly protecting freedom of expression and of the media from a wider economic perspective nemitz also believes that data reform will prove a boon not a burden particularly in the context of increased public awareness of internet privacy privacy has become a competitive differentiator and those that play by the rules are rewarded with more users and more clicks argues nemitz logue agrees here and says that both the ruling and the regulation are logical steps in how advertising and marketing should be regulated on the internet people dont really know how their information is being used for marketing purposes all business must operate within certain constraints many of which can foster innovation look at duckduckgo he also isnt concerned about the ability of internet giants like google and twitter to absorb the burden of such costs while for smaller companies the article 29 working party will shortly produce guidelines on compliance its a work in progress i dont think anyone is going to be made an example of he says but logue remains apprehensive about the economic and political implications of the regulation for freedom of expression there is also a right to know which comes under freedom of expression in the charter of fundamental rights of the european convention he points out the bigger risk here is in the push toward more privacy and secrecy modern economies work better where theres transparency and accountability if these are reduced by the new regulation then that would be a real risk to the economy 
with political failures left and right tech needs to rethink its strategy politics is the bte noire of hackers and entrepreneurs it lacks the precision and logic of a function in a computer program while being incredibly inefficient to boot taxi services have been bad for decades in cities like san francisco thanks to local politics but a dedicated technology startup managed to ameliorate the situation in just a handful of years this aversion to the democratic process is not just an unspoken taboo though but rather openly flaunted hackernews the news hub for hackers enshrines in its guidelines that most stories about politics are off topic for its discussions in the wake of the supreme courts decision about aereo though  it should be obvious that our general lack of interest of the political realm is becoming a burden as the size of the technology industry has grown fully grown startups are increasingly centers of power in our economy touching on areas well outside their traditional ken of science and technology to issues like health care employment and education these are socially contested policies in which many citizens hold passionate positions and the technology industrys agenda often becomes subsumed by larger objectives we can see this in a matter like immigration which is perhaps the most important subject facing silicon valleys economy today due to our current immigration system founders coming to america to start a business are mostly out of luck even if they receive investment funding or hire american employees a small handful may get through in extraordinary visa cases but this is exceedingly rare congress failed to pass a comprehensive bill on immigration the past two years despite bipartisan interest and as my colleague alex noted yesterday  further attempts at reform have been canceled for the foreseeable future its easy to blast congress for failing to move forward on immigration or on anything for that matter instead of blaming ourselves but our interests in immigration have also failed within the obama administration as well despite the heavy tech influence on the presidents campaign in 2010 the us citizen and immigration services agency changed its regulations on how it authorized visas  outlawing the practice where a founder sponsors their own visa through their startup thus one of the key pathways for immigrant entrepreneurs to legally build their companies in the united states was closed the technology industrys tribulations with immigration is a vivid vignette of our challenges in many other policy areas if politics is a form of narrative the tech industry is in desperate need of a new one for years we benefitted from a deep well of support among the general public and in washington for progress in the technological arts using a set of platitudes we all know well america is a quintessentially entrepreneurial nation a startup which saw its founders traveling across an ocean to start their new lives entrepreneurs create jobs while keeping the country competitive technology is a force for good creating incredible products that have truly made the world a better place however as i wrote about in my first column on techcrunch  silicon valley is increasingly a political target partly due to its size but also because of our callous approach to so many of the salient issues of our time employment remains the most important problem to people around the world yet disruption is increasingly replacing jobs with automation at a time when there is more concern than ever over manipulation and privacy tech companies conspired with the us government to allow all sorts of spying on citizens thus when we engage on an issue like immigration our progressive notions of science and technology suddenly seem deeply incompatible with the exigencies of politics part of the challenge is that there remains a latent and at times boisterous nativism concerning american jobs despite widespread evidence that high tech visa holders are some of the most important stakeholders in building startup companies but we have yet to develop the means to overcome such views and educate the american electorate on why a more open immigration policy is fundamentally good and also urgently needed for the us economic recovery but it is not just our interface with the world outside of the startup bubble that is problematic  even our internal narrative has become less cohesive take the issue surrounding netflix verizon and network neutrality the interests of netflix fundamentally diverge from those of startups in the video space since netflix has the budget to pay for net neutrality while startups dont the company originally agreed to pay verizon additional fees for peering then started fighting back while the company has since pushed back on the issue at the fcc the point remains the same our largest companies and earliest startups dont often share the same political goals net neutrality can evoke quite passionate viewpoints but to see a more intellectual example take a technology issue like the right to be forgotten  a major new policy development that affects startups and large companies alike while there has been a bit of a knee jerk reaction to the european court of justices decision there is a truly interesting question for engineers and founders to think about in their own products what kind of control should a user have over their information how discoverable should it be if information has been previously made public how should a startup handle a request to restrict access to that data our angle on issues like this is discordant and that makes it difficult to speak to policymakers with a collective voice i dont want to turn the clock back on progress startups have done incredible things for humanity over the past decades and i expect we will see even more incredible advances in the future but we have to engage more with the issues of today if we desire to have any influence on these debates the challenge is that the tech world has not always been accommodating to alternative points of view on many technology issues while the san francisco bay area is one of the most diverse places in the world culturally and economically it is simultaneously one of the most homogenous places on its political views as any election map can attest on technology in particular there is a very limited range of debate in places like san francisco or palo alto there is no solution for guaranteeing that our voice is heard but we can take some of the lessons from our startups and apply them to washington building a startup means understanding our users and encouraging them to join our products and that same empathy can be used in the political process we also need to think in a more lean mindset working on issues more locally first where change can happen faster in short we have the tools and we certainly have the need to engage in politics now we just need the effort featured image bryce durbin 
bites bytes and bits as the month of june cruises towards its end to mark the mid point of this unfolding year we have had a month of bites bytes and bits the world cup has delivered the surprising results of the group stages with the elimination of favourites such as defending holders spain and previous winners italy as well as the quick failure of other nations who were expected to perform much better such as portugal england russia and croatia the europeans are finding it tough going in brazil  not helped by some controversial refereeing that has clearly weighed against bosnia herzegovina and italy it is incomprehensible that a footballer of the quality of uruguays luis suarez has to revert to the physical biting of opponents at crucial times in a match to re shape doomed fortunes it is even more incomprehensible that he can do so with instant impunity to the detriment of opponents biting an opponent during a match is not only a grave offence punishable by instant dismissal in football but is also offensive to all sports in general not even in physical contact sports such as boxing and wrestling is biting tolerated it is also an offence easy to prove it requires no goal line technology it needs just common sense by match officials when faced with irrefutable evidence  especially if corroborated by the historical record of the imputed offender italy probably did not deserve to go through from the group but they probably did not deserve to go through even in 1982 either  when they eventually won the world cup in spain  and in 1994 when they lost the final in the usa being eliminated by a bite on the ground bites into the moral of a nation for whom football is a way of life     details were announced this week about the mechanics of the investment registration scheme 2014 irs 14 which essentially is a revised version of several similar schemes operated by past pn administrations but at a higher fee 75 per cent compared to the former three to five per cent tax offenders who are quickly losing the non disclosure protection of foreign jurisdictions are being offered a fairly easy way to regularise their past undisclosed and consequently untaxed earnings if these are still represented by assets that are eligible for registration under irs 14 these assets do not include cash but do now include property held in malta and loans to private companies human nature being what it is could make tax dodgers consider compliance with such schemes as a taxmans bite into their wealth in reality it is the tax dodgers bite into the public coffers in that they are being given an opportunity to regularise income that should have been taxed at rates between 15 per cent and 35 per cent by paying simply 75 per cent without any penalties or interest and in the process also being forgiven for offences related to social benefit fraud resulting from such formerly undeclared assets whilst one appreciates that this is a last chance to bring tax dodgers on board before international tax disclosure arrangements result in much more serious consequences and also the economic benefits of such hidden capital being given an easy chance to become active within the regular economy one also questions why tax dodgers should be given such favourable treatment compared to other forms of offenders against public funds offenders under vat legislation and those who defrauded enemalta by permitting tampering to their meters have received much harsher treatment whilst in their case penalties have been reduced conditional on full admission and disclosure they had to pay the full amount originally due plus reduced penalties on the other hand irs 14 and similar such schemes under previous administrations offer tax dodgers a substantial discount to regularise their position and retain their non disclosure cloak any tax offender who considers regularisation under irs 14 as a taxmans bite into their wealth is surely unfamiliar with the mechanics of tax amnesty schemes being given in other countries especially the uk and germany june 2014 was also the month when major technology companies such as apple samsung google and amazon revealed their product innovation plans to show how they are intending to keep consumers hooked by making their lifestyle dependant on such technology just as the smartphone has changed the mobile phone into a portable computer giving instant access to information on the move the next big thing will be how to make the smartphone the core source of not only external information but also of internal information and its management and control ranging from our own health to appliances within our homes putting so much information under one central technology control could be as convenient as it is scary knowing that so much confidential information is controlled by third parties who even if well intentioned could either exploit us commercially  as we become dependent on such technology  or themselves be exposed to criminal external hacking attacks that could gain illegal access to so much confidential details about us as technology extends its reach and dominates our lifestyle regulatory control must also keep up to ensure that consumer protection remains effective the eu is at the forefront of such regulatory up dating as was evident by the recent european court of justice ruling granting individuals the right to be forgotten when we leave home these days we have to ensure we carry three things the smart phone the watch and a wallet full of cash and all sorts of cards credit debit parking loyalty etc soon the smart phone will be all you need as it is linked to other wearable technology whether it be google glasses or i watches self driving cars will come later from the bytes to the bits as the world marked the centenary of the event which triggered world war i ie the assassination on 28 june 1914 of archduke franz ferdinand of austria and his wife sophie the eu basically marked the event by a divisive vote at the eu council for the nomination of jean claude juncker as president of the commission this nomination was strongly opposed by british prime minister david cameron who has spent so much political capital on it that it is difficult to see how he can defend british membership in the eu if he is re elected and keeps his pledge to hold an in or out referendum the defeat of cameron cannot be considered a victory for the 26 countries only hungary supported britains objections that supported junckers nomination the eu must inevitably re visit its internal structures and juncker is expertly positioned to lead such a project which might pleasantly surprise cameron ultimately those who have agreed to share their currency have also to agree that this is only sustainable if they agree to share many other things leading to the deepening of their political ties on federalist lines those who like britain do not agree to share their currency can then be given a much looser arrangement outside the basic conditions of a single market marking the centenary of the first world war  which was the main cause of the second world war many consider both wars as a continuous one with a 20 year non belligerence interlude should help realise how much we need to protect the peace that has been delivered across western and central europe over the last seven decades through the formation of the eu and its preceding versions the model must continue to evolve as the eu offers prospects to aspirants on the eastern front

surveillance and the open internet from the program revelations about the extent of us government surveillance of digital communications have changed the debate about internet governance online privacy and the role of the internet as a public sphere in a post snowden era how do we protect revelations from human rights activists of journalistic sources what does surveillance mean for vulnerable populations will surveillance change the web as we know it from a single connected network to one where national sovereignty is increasingly important speakers emily bell   tow center jillian york   electronic frontier foundation eff nathan freitas   the guardian project ethan zuckerman moderator liveblogging contributed by catherine dignazio ali hashmi jude mwenda and willow brugh the purpose of this session is to discuss surveillance in the open internet context the revelations on the us government surveillance of digital communications have triggered a debate on the issue of internet governance internet as a public sphere has vital for global and local democratic institutions in the post snowden era which is marked by surveillance how do we protect human right activists from coercive governments how do we protect journalistic sources what populations become vulnerable as a result of this surveillance these are some of the questions that we will be discussing in this session ethan zuckerman director of the mit center for civic media who is moderating this panel introduces the panel to the audience the panel of this session comprises emily bell  tow center jillian york  from electronic frontier foundation and nathan freitas  from the guardian project emily is a media commentator and analyst who writes about media and broadcasting jillian is an activist journalist and a writer freitas describes his work as make hack teach share secure and create at the guardian project on his twitter profile ethan introduces jillian york who has joined the panel at the last minute since another panelist could not attend jillian is one the worlds best prepared person for this program ethan says ethan introduces nathan as the benevolent dictator of the guardian project he is deeply involved with the tibet action institute as well he has worked for many years on issues of free speech and the internet emily bell was the head of digital content at tow center at columbia university prior to joining the tow center she worked with the guardian ethan wanted to talk through some of the implications of surveillance for the journalism community with emily ethan wants to have a conversation about the world post snowden what does this mean for activists for people trying to protect their communication for journalists for people who are interested in using the digital public sphere as a space to organize and debate nsa saga had very specific security implications emily says pre snowden the newsroom security practices were very weak particularly when talking about source protection etc there is also a broader application as well we had inappropriately close relationship with technology emily says there is great expediency for journalism in using freely available tools but there was no thought about what this meant the great thing for snowdens light on this is that it demonstrated vividly how they needed to protect themselves but also how systems of power work now in the age of big data even if you are not working with highly sensitive data you have to understand these systems journalist are there to uphold freedom of expression there are two aspects to this one is a broader question and one is very specific one ethan asks nathan to talk about the tools in this space he says nathan has taken on an important and challenging problem mobile phone security human rights activists understand mobile phones firstly as tracking devices nathan says that the issue of trust is at the forefront he began work with tibetan activists and secure mobile phones were extremely expensive to come by now you can download mobile phones install tor  use encrypted chat and its free for the users the question comes down why should i trust you instead of trusting google and other giants he says one of the biggest issues is around apps and the app store because the gatekeepers are not the open web we are a little screwed in some cases how do you get in front of people route around censorship of apps we need to ensure that people have access to these tools in an affordable way ethan asks about the app store idea we talk about users and usability it would be nice to just download an app and have it be secure whats the barrier that we are having in bringing android and apple apps to the market nathan says that they can put their app in the android store and its not a problem but in places like china there is local censorship of apps it doesnt seem as bad to people from a censorship standpoint than censoring a website the users trust companies like apple and google there is some value to the fact that these companies provide good service ethan turns to jill and tells a story he was in cairo 10 years ago meeting with the organization for personal rights gay rights he was there to see about them using tor and pgp they explained that they wouldnt use that software because everyone knew that the traffic on the internet was routed through 7 computers in the basement of the white house ethan thought that was crazy at the time until the snowden revelations but post snowden how is an organization like eff dealing with security nihilism jillian says when she talks to people that she gets two different perspective one is from silicon valley which say that we live in post privacy world on the other hand we have others who say that everything is tracked related to journalists they are willing to take personal risks but need to recognize that its about protecting their sources as well the other side of the coin   the strong powerful white male voices from silicon valley telling you that privacy is not important   this is much more difficult ease of use and usability make it a lot easier for people to use them protocols like pretty good privacy pgp are hard jillian says compared with less secure interactions ethan asks how online culture commercial culture is tied into this one of the responses has been whats the problem youve been telling corporations everything all along bruce schnier says surveillance is the business model of the internet is there a connection between giving up certain amounts of privacy and getting free services jillian says that there is a difference between the things she says on social media and more secure communication platforms there is a difference between facebook and twitter in terms of privacy interaction she says just like governments can change anything so can companies companies having that information should be a choice not just a default emily says that one of the principal cultural differences is centralized power vs free market economy in america the corporate sphere rules all the public sphere is a private sphere which tolerates free speech the right to be forgotten recently came down in the court recently in the eu you can have your search results removed from googles cache regulation in the us is small regulation in other markets is front and center one of the balances to the enormous corporate power emily says that internet is really a private sphere that tolerates free speech she thinks we need an intelligent conversation with government she pushes back and says that she is surprised that more people in the us are paying attention than she would have thought american public media is google it is facebook emily says it is imposing privacy standards on rest of the world snowden brought the debate on surveillance beyond the locus of dc and new york but there is a danger that this debate will fizzle out nathan talks about his experience with wechat an app used by tibetan activists every message you send goes through beijing data centers and is subject to monitoring by people he hates wechat he was at a meeting where a researcher was looking at the guts of the code and it turns out they are using guardian project software in their system why did they use it chinese companies employed encryption techniques to protect its users we are starting to see google doing end to end encryption we are doing that by creating apps that are privacy centric applications such as obscure cam or informa cam they need journalists to adopt these tools ethan says the concept of the library or toolkit that is reusable by other orgs is powerful one of the reasons wed like large corporations to do this is that the scaling problems around these things is hard eg tor making people a target of surveillance he turns to emily regarding the privately held public sphere and says that it is a sphere that also always works on us laws ethan was in myanmar for a conference on freedom of expression he interacted with many activists he found out that for them internet is facebook in addition his friends in myanmar wanted facebook to be censoring posts specifically hate speech posts this was incredibly uncomfortable for ethan if there is a public sphere there needs to be protection for people because this can really hurt people in real ways the big private companies regulate and deal with privacy issues more immediately than say governments emily says she wouldnt stand against the standard of free speech but the us is a self censoring society as well free speech can also mean people living in fear of hate speech and organized aggression its difficult because we should be working towards openness we need a debate where major platform companies say what they do is editorial they say we are just a tech company we cant have the debate with them until the mark zuckerburgs and brins really engage with this they have enormous power over how people live their lives and they need to be brought into the discussion nobody can pretend that it is not an editorial act to tweak a news algorithm its a journalists job to understand these systems as well as the companies do they are new systems of power the reason snowden was valuable is that you had some acknowledgement from the tech leaders nathan talks about the issue of ethnic violence if you share the act of self immolation then that is not allowed you have the terrorism vs freedom fighter debate ethan asks him about weibo nathan says that the issue then becomes a debate between local and global normative values in other words local companies are important maybe put aside nationalism and developers can do end to end encryption and help the internet work better ethan asks jillian how are you talking with entities that deal with freedom of expression and internet privacy jillian gives an example twitter took down some content at the request of the pakistani government the pakistani order was questionable twitter did the right thing by putting it back up this is the thing that concerns me they are handing data to governments where they have no offices twitter and facebook gives user data to countries and governments without any democratic transparency the companies are making these decisions without any local expertise most of the companies do not have diversity teams the companies need to be consulting with local experts and organizations she doesnt trust the companies to get this right ethan opens the floor to questions rebekah monson  i was intrigued by nathans comments on weibo and tencent do you see evidence that chinese companies are pushing back on state bureaus nathan answers is negative but they might not be as horrible as they are sometimes made out to be he says however there are reports of tibetans being arrested after posting something on the weibo caitlin thompson from wnyc  the migration of journalists to tech companies what do you all think of the responsibility is of the journalists in this case emily the responsibility for educating people as to what journalism actually is journalism isnt going to make these companies money its going to make it hard to make money there are advantages to having platforms like twitter its just important to be aware of how these systems work advocating for what is intrinsically journalistic vs what is intrinsically commercial is part of that role audience theres a challenge now in getting a source how do you get a government source who will talk to you if they know cell phones are tapped is there a new way to get them emily there was a report about this the problems is not security but rather that no one wants to talk nathan barton  has the best security in the business platforms like global leaks and secure drop they raise the bar for the way they accept content they protect sources by default there are free apps jillian she puts a call to take these encryption technologies and make them global not just us focused audience in my discussions with newsroom people they do not recommend officially for security practices i want to ask whether you came across newsrooms where these practices were in place emily when i was at the guardian there were practices from individual reporters getting it institutionally supported was harder the tools have gotten better but we need more progress on that also on threat modeling sometimes its not possible to guarantee safety what are low tech solutions as well journalism schools have got to really up their game and close that skills gap jillian encryption works but encryption tools are like condoms which are not 100 percent safe nathan im inspired by the tibetan activists who still maintain hope in the face of challenges take small steps thats what we should be doing audience i use tor but it has its issues nearly 80 percent of users use it for illegal activities and it is not usable it is slow many people use it for illegal things nathan i am a developer so biased you may not need ultimate security of tails you have to find what works for you i would say tor is not slow jillian in terms of legal aspects lets take the analogy of cars they cause pollution and result in accidental deaths but they have their utility micah sifry emily   my surveys of journalists in the us is that 1 5 of journalists use secure communications   why jillian   same question but related to activists nathan   who pays for these tools i believe the adage is that if we are not paying then we are the product so why arent we paying for tor emily bell 1 5 percent is where it should be because they dont have time to go through with this snowden saga shows that it is needed not only for journalists but for eveyone jillian developers need to listen to users and take their feedback seriously make the tools multilingual until these tools are as easy to use as a toaster people wont use them make them seamless nathan we are lucky to benefit from various sources your taxes are paying us if you are american knight news foundation eric schmidt that can go on for awhile but not forever i need to talk to mozilla and apache im inspired by them im interested to see what silent circle is doing but you then end up privileging corporations im looking for a longer term plan and help with that 
eu right to be forgotten threatens innovation and the free and open internet the government has pushed hard to promote britain as the best place in europe to start a technology business it has endorsed the many digital start ups based in tech city and is keen to develop technology and digital industries around the uk it is right to do so the internet accounts for a greater percentage of our gdp than it does for any other g20 economy and its growing fast e commerce is expected to be worth 140billion to the uk by 2016 as a result we have the most to lose if legislation makes doing business online harder policymakers should therefore be standing up to take note of todays ruling by the european union court of justice on the right to be forgotten in a landmark case spanish citizen mario costeja gonzlez complained that a 16 year old auction notice of his repossessed home on googles search results infringed his privacy in its judgment the court made the assertion that people had the right to request the removal of information that appeared to be inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant they went so far as to add that even accurate data that had been lawfully published could in the course of time become incompatible with the data protection directive for anyone who values a free and open internet who supports freedom of speech and who believes that europe should be working to promote innovation in the digital economy this is a worrying development and risks setting dangerous precedents who for example should get to decide what counts as inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant such vague terminology seems to open the door for anyone to challenge almost anything that is written about them online imagine the reaction if those same principles were suggested of print journalism or book publishing the success of the world wide web has been built not just on open technical standards but on the free and open exchange of information any suggestion that individuals should be editors of all content that references them surely amounts to censorship in all but name the ruling also places blame in the wrong place search engines exist to index information  they do not host or control the content that is uploaded if there are instances where information about an individual genuinely should not be online then that case should be made against the owners of the site that holds the information  not those that signpost it revealingly the spanish data protection agency had already rejected gonzlezs complaint against the vanguardia website which hosted the information about him given that how does it then make sense to blame the middleman its not just about the giants opening intermediaries to requests to change or remove information is also potentially unworkable for companies the size of google which has over 1 billion users it would be an almost impossible task to investigate and respond to every request fairly but this is not just about the tech giants placing the same legal liability on the hundreds of start ups and smes across europe that are developing platforms to improve our online experience would be likely to represent an untenable legal burden that could stop them operating at all the result would be that we stifle the self same innovation economy that politicians across europe have said they wish to promote and on which the uk economy will increasingly depend according to the guardian the ministry of justice has estimated that the european commissions wider proposals on data regulation could cost british businesses 360m a year the right to be forgotten does not bring data protection rules from the digital stone age into todays modern computing world as claimed by eu justice commissioner viviane reding rather it looks like a backward step that risks changing the nature of the free and open internet as we know it the government says it is seeking a british opt out from any right to be forgotten law as it raises unrealistic and unfair expectations they are right in the light of todays ruling britain now needs to make that case loud and clear follow eddie copeland on twitter eddieacopeland 
dont panic web firms the euro google right to be forgotten isnt a problem comment are you an internet company beware of companies and organisations purporting to help european firms interpret the new google privacy ruling you may find yourself taking unnecessary mitigation measures   and fuelling the trolls last week the ecj ruled that google was subject to european privacy and data protection laws leading to a rash of alarmist and often inaccurate stories trade groups and law firms have piled onto the bandwagon issuing dark warnings to startups but the advice could lead companies to spend unnecessarily   since the ruling doesnt apply to small companies only huge multinationals the problem is as with the media reporting that much of the interpretation of the ecj ruling on offer this week is misleading the ruling only applies to companies with enormous societal impact   like google and possibly facebook a startup with few users is not considered to have huge reputational impact paul sanders who started shoreditchs oldest digital company   and opened one of the world wide webs first user generated sites the nowhere guide of 1993 told the register that small digital companies spending on mitigation against the ecj should save their cash theyre totally wasting their money sanders told us there are normal rules that apply to being a publisher and to being a platform that allows others to publish any startup should take account of those rules just as it takes account of other rules in society but nothing has changed so advice spent on legal fees to mitigate against the ecj will be money wasted so too is money allocated to hiring takedown teams the large multinational companies affected can bounce the complaint to a court where an information commissioner or judge will decide on the merits of the complaint dont take our word for it check for yourself online   its about search engines   and specifically search engines with a far greater impact than publishers of a web page any guesses we found two interesting examples weve spotted of ambulance chasing advisors there are probably more heres the first never let a crisis go to waste so we can largely disregard media alarmism of the sort which has been all too common in the wake of the ecj ruling im policy independent of my organ grinder in particular we can disregard the doom warnings from digital economy lobby group coadec founded in 2010 but recently reactivated guy levin a former special advisor to george osborne who joined coadec in march gloomily foretells that  it can only be a matter of time before similar requests go to other platforms and services levin quotes two sources   neither of whom is a lawyer and one of whom is jimmy wales both get the ecj ruling badly wrong wales even insisted it applied to news organisations ignoring the public interest defence explicit in the ecj ruling coadec it is not surprising to find was set up with funding from google many of the issues coadec raises   such as lobbying for weaker laws defending intellctual property   are aligned with googles own commercial interests and echo its own lobbying google after all makes its money by assembling pages full of other peoples ip and placing ads in them levin confirmed to us via twitter that google has made further donations to the groupuscule since launch and that techhub is also a coadec funder that gives google two throws techhub is jointly funded by bt and google but levin insisted we retain policy independence google makes donations to no fewer than 150 us pressure groups a recent washington post investigation revealed with a useful interactive graphic here illustrating the advertising behemoths enormous influence over the technology policy agenda and over media discussions of technology one unique companys policy position is echoed and re echoed and turns into the digital sector consensus this squeezes out alternative policies and different points of view this was illustrated this week the ecj ruling could just have easily been reported as a judgement empowering the individual against large multinational corporations   which it is instead googles private concerns about its own costs and liabilities were portrayed as a national emergency so relax startups  unless youre a search engine that expects to have the global reputational impact that google does now by say tomorrow morning you dont have to worry about the ecjs privacy ruling the casual reader may marvel at how closely the technology consensus we seem to reach these days always aligns so closely with the concerns felt by just such a mighty scraper advertising platform sorry search engine  
europes sweeping data privacy reforms put google facebook and apple in regulatory crosshairs under sweeping data privacy laws finalized in europe late tuesday the european union said it will levy significant penalties on all companies that fail to protect personal data or otherwise mishandle consumers sensitive information    and that could mean big problems on the continent for us tech giants like google apple facebook and twitter beyond the financial impact i expect the first few fines levied by regulators to be very significant economic inhibitor todays agreement builds a strong basis to help europe develop innovative digital services facebook likes the rules we welcome consistent regulations that enable all companies to comply with the same standards across europe under the guidance of one lead supervisory authority photo reuters along with antitrust investigations into microsoft and google and a probe into apples tax affairs the european court of justice earlier this year ruled the safe harbor agreement invalid  ending a 15 year old agreement which allows for the easy transfer of data between europe and the us while the reforms have been agreed upon there is still work to be done before the final versions of the texts are presented to the european parliament and council in early 2016 and this may be causing some confusion changes to the definition of what is and is not personal data the need for explicit consent for data collection and different documentation requirements all need to be interpreted and any relevant changes made richard brown from us based cloud security company arbor networks told ibt 
tech spats spark fears of digital protectionism washington as american tech giants extend their global reach fears are growing on their side of the atlantic over trade barriers some see as digital protectionism while china has long been a difficult market for us firms to navigate tensions have been rising with the european union on privacy antitrust and other issues impacting tech firms such as google facebook and uber in recent weeks europes highest court struck down an agreement which allowed us firms to transfer personal data out of the region without running afoul of privacy rules in parallel brussels is looking to create a new digital single market simplifying rules for operating across eu borders  but which could also include new regulations for online platforms some see this as a jab at us retailers like amazon sharing economy services like airbnb or even news outfits ed black president of the computer and communications industry association said the platform proposal has the potential to be troublesome nobody has defined what a platform is black told afp it feels like a proposal to solve a non problem after the european court of justice invalidated the so called safe harbor data sharing agreement this month secretary of commerce penny pritzker said washington was deeply disappointed for the past 15 years the key transatlantic accord allowed tech firms like facebook to operate on both sides of the ocean without running afoul of eu privacy laws the ruling pritzker said creates significant uncertainty for both us and eu companies and consumers and puts at risk the thriving transatlantic digital economy undercurrent of fear were waiting to see which way europe goes says daniel castro vice president at the information technology  innovation foundation a washington think tank castro detects an undercurrent of fear in europe because of the popularity of services such as google and facebook but argues that the us and eu need to be on the same side when it comes to free trade another source of friction is europes effort to enforce the right to be forgotten allowing individuals to remove online content from searches that are outdated or inaccurate france has ordered google to carry this out worldwide not just in europe  but us firms see this as a form of censorship effectively enabling people to rewrite history to hide embarrassing data youre taking about europe imposing its version of how the world should be on everyone else castro said president barack obama expressed concerns about digital trade barriers in an interview earlier this year with recode we have owned the internet our companies have created it expanded it perfected it in ways that european firms cant compete obama said in response to a question about european actions in the digital sphere and oftentimes what is portrayed as high minded positions on issues sometimes is just designed to carve out some of their commercial interests buy time for europe that view was echoed by kati suominen who heads the future of trade initiative for the centre for strategic and international studies a think tank europe sees it is lagging and is moving on policies in order to buy time she argued europe is seeking to build its own digital economy by complicating the operations of foreign companies on european soil in that sense it is protectionism she said rather than throw up new barriers she argued europe should be tearing them if it wishes to foster a digital economy  notably to enable better access to venture capital last month guenther oettinger the eu commissioner for the digital economy and society brushed aside suggestions of protectionism our rules on a european level are relevant for everybody for european producers and players for asian players and for american players as well he said during a visit to san francisco snowden impact while google has been the target of a contentious eu anti trust probe among other issues facebook has been especially impacted by privacy rules with ireland become the latest to examine the legality of its transfer of user data across the atlantic belgian officials have also sought to prevent facebook from using a data cookie that gathers information about users the social media giant says the tool helps verify legitimate accounts and combat spam a key element in the us eu row over privacy has been the fear that us internet firms are handing over data to the national security agency in light of revelations from former intelligence contractor edward snowden to address those concerns us lawmakers have moved to pass a bill allowing non citizens to enforce their data protection rights in us courts under the privacy act berin szoka president of the activist group techfreedom said the bill was a step toward repairing americas tarnished image on data privacy he noted that the failure until now to address the issue in washington has provoked an international crisis  one that could lead to a european blockade of american internet companies suominen argued that the us and eu have an chance to foster a flourishing digital economy  with appropriate rules  as part of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip currently being negotiated but she warned that policymakers need to bring their thinking up to date policymakers are struggling to understand what these technologies are and what they can do and we have archaic policies from the 20th century she said i worry that we are not on the right path for the 21st century  afp 
agreement on commissions eu data protection reform will boost digital single market the european commission put forward its eu data protection reform in january 2012 to make europe fit for the digital age  ip1246  today an agreement was found with the european parliament and the council following final negotiations between the three institutions so called trilogue meetings more than 90 of europeans say they want the same data protection rights across the eu  and regardless of where their data is processed this will soon be a reality the reform package will put an end to the patchwork of data protection rules that currently exists in the eu andrus ansip  vice president for the digital single market said  todays agreement is a major step towards a digital single market it will remove barriers and unlock opportunities the digital future of europe can only be built on trust with solid common standards for data protection people can be sure they are in control of their personal information and they can enjoy all the services and opportunities of a digital single market we should not see privacy and data protection as holding back economic activities they are in fact an essential competitive advantage todays agreement builds a strong basis to help europe develop innovative digital services our next step is now to remove unjustified barriers which limit cross border data flow local practice and sometimes national law limiting storage and processing of certain data outside national territory so let us move ahead and build an open and thriving data economy in the eu  based on the highest data protection standards and without unjustified barriers vra jourov  commissioner for justice consumers and gender equality said  today we deliver on the promise of the juncker commission to finalize data protection reform in 2015 these new pan european rules are good for citizens and good for businesses citizens and businesses will profit from clear rules that are fit for the digital age that give strong protection and at the same time create opportunities and encourage innovation in a european digital single market and harmonised data protection rules for police and criminal justice authorities will ease law enforcement cooperation between member states based on mutual trust contributing to the european agenda for security the reform consists of two instruments the general data protection regulation will enable people to better control their personal data at the same time modernised and unified rules will allow businesses to make the most of the opportunities of the digital single market by cutting red tape and benefiting from reinforced consumer trust the data protection directive for the police and criminal justice sector will ensure that the data of victims witnesses and suspects of crimes are duly protected in the context of a criminal investigation or a law enforcement action at the same time more harmonised laws will also facilitate cross border cooperation of police or prosecutors to combat crime and terrorism more effectively across europe a fundamental right for citizens the reform will allow people to regain control of their personal data two thirds of europeans 67 according to a recent eurobarometer survey stated they are concerned about not having complete control over the information they provide online seven europeans out of ten worry about the potential use that companies may make of the information disclosed the data protection reform will strengthen the right to data protection which is a fundamental right in the eu and allow them to have trust when they give their personal data the new rules address these concerns by strengthening the existing rights and empowering individuals with more control over their personal data most notably these include easier access to your own data  individuals will have more information on how their data is processed and this information should be available in a clear and understandable way a right to data portability  it will be easier to transfer your personal data between service providers a clarified  right to be forgotten   when you no longer want your data to be processed and provided that there are no legitimate grounds for retaining it the data will be deleted the right to know when your data has been hacked for example companies and organisations must notify the national supervisory authority of serious data breaches as soon as possible so that users can take appropriate measures clear modern rules for businesses in todays digital economy personal data has acquired enormous economic significance in particular in the area of big data by unifying europes rules on data protection lawmakers are creating a business opportunity and encouraging innovation one continent one law  the regulation will establish one single set of rules which will make it simpler and cheaper for companies to do business in the eu one stop shop  businesses will only have to deal with one single supervisory authority this is estimated to save 23 billion per year european rules on european soil  companies based outside of europe will have to apply the same rules when offering services in the eu risk based approach the rules will avoid a burdensome one size fits all obligation and rather tailor them to the respective risks rules fit for innovation the regulation will guarantee that data protection safeguards are built into products and services from the earliest stage of development data protection by design privacy friendly techniques such as pseudonomysation will be encouraged to reap the benefits of big data innovation while protecting privacy benefits for big and small alike the data protection reform will stimulate economic growth by cutting costs and red tape for european business especially for small and medium enterprises smes the eus data protection reform will help smes break into new markets under the new rules smes will benefit from four reductions in red tape no more notifications  notifications to supervisory authorities are a formality that represents a cost for business of 130 million every year the reform will scrap these entirely every penny counts  where requests to access data are manifestly unfounded or excessive smes will be able to charge a fee for providing access data protection officers  smes are exempt from the obligation to appoint a data protection officer insofar as data processing is not their core business activity impact assessments  smes will have no obligation to carry out an impact assessment unless there is a high risk protecting personal data in the area of law enforcement better cooperation between law enforcement authorities with the new data protection directive for police and criminal justice authorities law enforcement authorities in eu member states will be able to exchange information necessary for investigations more efficiently and effectively improving cooperation in the fight against terrorism and other serious crime in europe the data protection directive for police and criminal justice authorities takes account of the specific needs of law enforcement respects the different legal traditions in member states and is fully in line with the charter of fundamental rights better protection of citizens data individuals personal data will be better protected whenprocessed for any law enforcement purpose including prevention of crime it will protect everyone  regardless of whether they are a victim criminal or witness all law enforcement processing in the union must comply with the principles of necessity proportionality and legality with appropriate safeguards for the individuals supervision is ensured by independent national data protection authorities and effective judicial remedies must be provided the data protection directive for police and criminal justice authorities provides clear rules for the transfer of personal data by law enforcement authorities outside the eu to ensure that the level of protection of individuals guaranteed in the eu is not undermined next steps following political agreement reached in trilogue the final texts will be formally adopted by the european parliament and council at the beginning 2016 the new rules will become applicable two years thereafter the commission will work closely with member state data protection authorities to ensure a uniform application of the new rules during the two year transition phase the commission will inform citizens about their rights and companies about their obligations data protection authorities will work more closely together in the future especially through the one stop shop mechanism to solve cross border data protection cases background the data protection package is a key enabler of the digital single market and the eu agenda on security proposed by then eu justice commissioner vice president viviane reding in january 2012 see ip1246  the data protection reform package includes the general data protection regulation and the data protection directive for police and criminal justice authorities it updates and replaces the current data protection rules that are based on the 1995 data protection directive and the 2008 framework decision for the police and criminal justice sector for more information eu data

eu legislation and us bullying put cloud users between a rock and a hard place government departments and regulatory bodies have been espousing the benefits of cloud computing for years now and for good reason the benefits of cloud computing are huge and have the potential not only to streamline most businesses existing work processes but fundamentally to change the way we do commerce for example as we noted in our top 10 cloud computing benefits feature in july the cloud not only lets workers access data anytime anywhere it reduces company costs removing the need for firms to install and manage their own hardware so businesses of all sizes particularly in the uk  which is listed by the european commission ec and numerous analyst houses as the technologys fastest european adopter  have taken an interest in the cloud and the competitive advantages it offers yet despite this interest widespread adoption of the cloud is still being severely hampered by many factors chief of which is uncertainty around data protection data protection has always been a concern about cloud computing as a lack of knowledge about the technology leaves many firms unclear where exactly their data is going and whether it is compliant with current legislation however the question of data protection became doubly important over the past year following news of the national security agencys notorious prism campaign documents leaked to the press showed that the nsa is demanding that numerous technology companies  including ibm microsoft and apple  hand over web user information passing through their data centres in 2013 this is not only bad from a human rights perspective but the discovery has led many firms to slow if not stop their cloud plans many cloud service providers have been working hard to regain their customers trust announcing a wave of security updates and plans to let customers pick the geographic location of the data centre that handles their information sadly though this isnt enough to solve the problem thanks to a recent ruling by a us judge in new york on the extent to which agencies can use the us patriot act  departments such as the nsa have the legal right to request data stored by us based cloud service providers regardless of the location of their data centres this means that even if you tell the provider to run your data only through european data centres its still not necessarily secure the issue of how the us patriot act will affect cloud service users is compounded by recent ec legislation that will put an increased onus on cloud service providers to self manage information passing through their data centres the legislation works to create a new set of common data protection standards one of the biggest changes in the legislation is that cloud service providers including google and microsoft would be legally obliged to remove information from indexing during searches when requested while this is great on paper as noted by the uk government and many analysts on a practical level the right to be forgotten is very difficult and costly to implement and could harm cloud users and providers for example firms that invest time and resources to become compliant with the new safeguards could find themselves in an awkward situation if the legislation isnt ratified later this year equally those that hedge their bets on its not passing could find themselves faced with a hefty bill later this year if they do nothing and it is approved it becomes even more difficult when you consider the problems firms could face toeing the line between the eu right to be forgotten and the us patriot act for example what will happen if a business is faced with requests from an eu customer for data to be deleted at the same time it receives a patriot act collection order from a us agency this shows that many cloud users and service providers are currently in something of a bind when it comes to cloud adoption in todays world it seems that businesses have the impossible choice of playing it safe and forgoing the undeniable benefits of cloud computing thus losing an edge in the increasingly competitive global economy or taking advantage of the technology and risking falling foul of a regulatory body hopefully politicians will realise this before the inevitable economic shortfall caused by stuttered cloud adoption takes effect on both sides of the pond and lets also hope that us and european governments will finally start the open conversation thats needed to end this ridiculous situation but given the ongoing bullish approach of the us towards european web users data  im not holding my breath 
hitachi data systems right to be forgotten is a pipe dream the european unions proposal to give internet users the right to be forgotten is unfeasible according to bob plumridge chief technology officer cto for emea at hitachi data systems at the start of this year the european commission proposed a new law that would allow people to demand that organisations that hold their data delete that data  unless there are legitimate grounds to retain it european union justice commissioner viviane reding said that the new rules would help build trust in online services because people would be better informed about their rights and in more control of their information while the intentions behind this proposed legislation are good plumridge said there is a gap between what policy makers would like to do and what technology is actually capable of doing say someone comes to me and says i want you to erase all the information you hold on me i could do that off the online systems pretty easily but various studies show that on average most corporates have up to nine copies of any unique data he says some of that data could be locked in a vault in a mountain somewhere because thats the ultimate dr protection so do i have to go and delete those individual records every time somebody says please delete everything you hold on me doesnt sound very practical to me plumridge believes that the people who are coming up with ideas to improve privacy do not understand the limits of todays technologies he said that for the right to be forgotten to become a reality all of these individual records would need to be linked together you would have your master copy and every time a copy of that is made there would be a link between the original and the copy so if the original is altered this modification is cascaded through all the copies he says however having links between all copies of the data means that if one copy is corrupted all the others are at risk of being affected part of having a good disaster recovery policy is ensuring that back up copies are not affected by any event that befalls the master copy furthermore some businesses are required to hold onto data for compliance reasons for example the financial services authority fsa requires banks to keep details of all banking transactions for a number of years so they would not be able to comply with a deletion request even if that customer had left he bank i think whats happening is these things are coming out of the policy making side he says people are starting to look at them and say is that really practical good idea but maybe we cant do it now maybe well be able to do it in two years time data and the real time economy the question of how personal data should be used is becoming increasingly important in the real time economy companies with access to your data are not only able to see who you are and how to contact you but where you are right now and what you are doing  information that is potentially very sensitive this information is extremely valuable to companies because it gives them deep insight into who their customers are allowing them to tightly focus their marketing efforts and respond quickly to customer demand however collecting data is not an end itself  the key is to know how to make use of that data while still protecting customers privacy some companies are now employing specialist data scientists to analyse their data and compile reports that will inform future corporate policy this often involves depersonalising data so that it cannot be connected with a particular individual plumridge says that while this is an interesting concept it will ultimately become impractical as volumes of data grow hitachi has therefore been sinking large amounts of money into rd around analytical engines data protection and data linkage that can automate data processing i think its inevitable that the big data revolution will rely on machine to machine communication he says i just cannot see how an individual would be able to trawl through what is potentially megabytes and even potentially terabytes of data even if they could the result they come up with would be so long after the event that the result would be almost worthless he gives the example of the japanese bullet trains which are built by hitachi in the past employees had to walk along the track at night and identify where maintenance work needed to be done however about nine months ago the company started mounting digital cctv cameras externally on the trains to record the condition of the tracks as they go along when a train arrives at its destination it offloads the data to a server running an analytical engine which goes through the data and identifies areas of the track that require maintenance work that information is then packaged up and sent directly to the various maintenance depots along the length of the track within an hour of a train pulling into the station the analytics stuff has been done and the maintenance work is prepared this also means that the maintenance teams know exactly what has been done and why it was done and that performs part of their archive of the rail system he explains 
tech spats spark us fears of digital protectionism washington afp   as american tech giants extend their global reach fears are growing on their side of the atlantic over trade barriers some see as digital protectionism while china has long been a difficult market for us firms to navigate tensions have been rising with the european union on privacy antitrust and other issues impacting tech firms such as google facebook and uber in recent weeks europes highest court struck down an agreement which allowed us firms to transfer personal data out of the region without running afoul of privacy rules in parallel brussels is looking to create a new digital single market simplifying rules for operating across eu borders    but which could also include new regulations for online platforms some see this as a jab at us retailers like amazon sharing economy services like airbnb or even news outfits ed black president of the computer and communications industry association said the platform proposal has the potential to be troublesome nobody has defined what a platform is black told afp it feels like a proposal to solve a non problem after the european court of justice invalidated the so called safe harbor data sharing agreement this month secretary of commerce penny pritzker said washington was deeply disappointed for the past 15 years the key transatlantic accord allowed tech firms like facebook to operate on both sides of the ocean without running afoul of eu privacy laws the ruling pritzker said creates significant uncertainty for both us and eu companies and consumers and puts at risk the thriving transatlantic digital economy   undercurrent of fear   were waiting to see which way europe goes says daniel castro vice president at the information technology  innovation foundation a washington think tank castro detects an undercurrent of fear in europe because of the popularity of services such as google and facebook but argues that the us and eu need to be on the same side when it comes to free trade another source of friction is europes effort to enforce the right to be forgotten allowing individuals to remove online content from searches that are outdated or inaccurate france has ordered google to carry this out worldwide not just in europe    but us firms see this as a form of censorship effectively enabling people to rewrite history to hide embarrassing data youre talking about europe imposing its version of how the world should be on everyone else castro said president barack obama expressed concerns about digital trade barriers in an interview earlier this year with recode we have owned the internet our companies have created it expanded it perfected it in ways that european firms cant compete obama said in response to a question about european actions in the digital sphere and oftentimes what is portrayed as high minded positions on issues sometimes is just designed to carve out some of their commercial interests   buy time for europe   that view was echoed by kati suominen who heads the future of trade initiative for the center for strategic and international studies a think tank europe sees it is lagging and is moving on policies in order to buy time she argued europe is seeking to build its own digital economy by complicating the operations of foreign companies on european soil in that sense it is protectionism she said rather than throw up new barriers she argued europe should be tearing them down if it wishes to foster a digital economy    notably to enable better access to venture capital last month guenther oettinger the eu commissioner for the digital economy and society brushed aside suggestions of protectionism our rules on a european level are relevant for everybody for european producers and players for asian players and for american players as well he said during a visit to san francisco   snowden impact   while google has been the target of a contentious eu anti trust probe among other issues facebook has been especially impacted by privacy rules with ireland becoming the latest to examine the legality of its transfer of user data across the atlantic belgian officials have also sought to prevent facebook from using a data cookie that gathers information about users the social media giant says the tool helps verify legitimate accounts and combat spam a key element in the us eu row over privacy has been the fear that us internet firms are handing over data to the national security agency in light of revelations from former intelligence contractor edward snowden to address those concerns us lawmakers have moved to pass a bill allowing non citizens to enforce their data protection rights in us courts under the privacy act berin szoka president of the activist group techfreedom said the bill was a step toward repairing americas tarnished image on data privacy he noted that the failure until now to address the issue in washington has provoked an international crisis    one that could lead to a european blockade of american internet companies suominen argued that the us and eu have a chance to foster a flourishing digital economy    with appropriate rules    as part of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip currently being negotiated but she warned that policymakers need to bring their thinking up to date policymakers are struggling to understand what these technologies are and what they can do and we have archaic policies from the 20th century she said i worry that we are not on the right path for the 21st century

states and that you have read and agree to the terms of use and the privacy policy only one out of 100 cloud service providers are ready for the new data protection directive that aims to modernise the older directive to suit the needs of the internet and cloud era the new directive which could be passed in 2014 for implementation in 2015 requires data controllers enterprises that own the data and data processors such as cloud providers and datacentre hosting companies to share the liability for data breaches and violations of the law the proposed regulation will apply to european businesses that process personal data and businesses outside the eu that monitor eu citizens or process personal data obtained from offering goods or services to eu citizens but the study of more than 7000 cloud services by security provider skyhigh networks revealed that suppliers have significant issues around new regulatory requirements such as data residency data breach detection and notification encryption and data deletion policies  the right to be forgotten  the hefty fines will make data protection a boardroom issue and will require companies to carefully review what they need to do to comply its staggering how few cloud providers are prepared for the new eu regulations but fortunately theres still time for providers to get into shape this means addressing a number of complex issues now such as the right to be forgotten as well as implementing data protection policies that meet these new standards said charlie howe european director for skyhigh networks the latest directive is aimed at strengthening consumer and business trust in europes digital economy for cloud providers this will inevitably require additional resources and expenditures but its a snip given the proposed penalties for violating the new laws which can be up to 5 of a companys annual revenue or up to 100m he warned this is in stark contrast with the 1995 data protection directive which offers no guidance on penalties the hefty fines will make data protection a boardroom issue and will require companies to carefully review what they need to do to comply according to some experts the proposed law governs how organisations treat the privacy of personal data and has far reaching implications experts warned the right to be forgotten  a massive headache one of the most well publicised and controversial amendments to the new regulation is the right to be forgotten  where individuals have the civil right to request that personal information be removed from the internet it is a complex issue but given the media interest surrounding it one thats unlikely to blindside cloud providers howe said still when you consider that the average organisation uses 738 cloud services complying with this requirement presents some unique challenges a big problem is that 63 of cloud providers maintain data indefinitely or have no provisions for data retention in their terms and conditions he added on top of this another 23 of cloud providers maintain the right to share data with another third party in their terms and conditions making it even more difficult to ensure all copies are deleted the study found its fair to say that the right to be forgotten could turn out to be a massive headache for many organisations  cloud service providers themselves and those companies using these services  its not just an issue for google howe said the study also revealed that only 11 countries satisfy eu privacy requirements around data residency the regulation requires that enterprises do not store in or transfer data through countries outside the european economic area that do not have equivalently strong data protection standards the data residency requirements also apply to cloud providers with datacentres around the world which in the normal course of operation may transfer and store data in countries that do not meet european privacy rules the us where the majority 67 of all cloud datacentres are headquartered is not among these 11 countries more on eu general data protection regulation data residency will be a significant issue for cloud services when the new regulations come into force  especially as only 89 of us providers have the safe harbor certification  which provides exemption to these regulations according to skyhigh networks a draft version of the new regulation would require organisations to notify eu regulatory authorities within 24 hours of a data breach even if the breach occurs in a third party cloud service the problem arises from the fact that many cloud providers expressly put the responsibility on the customer to detect breaches and this can be an impossible task said howe some existing regulations including the uk general data protection regulation and france data protection act allow organisations to circumvent breach notification requirements if data is made inaccessible to third parties using encryption unfortunately only 12 of cloud providers today provide the tenant managed encryption keys required to do so he added existing european data privacy laws also require that organisations take steps to protect personal information for instance the france data protection authority cnil recommends strong passwords secure workstations network security and information security training the challenge is that not all cloud providers offer tools to secure data natively in fact only 29 of cloud services enforce secure passwords the general data protection regulation does not come into effect until 2015 but theres some serious work to do before that howe concluded

looking forward   medium in surveying the global digital landscape several starkly different realities are evident each with its own set of priorities and problems for much of the worlds population simply getting online is the most pressing issue of the day a major concern is that the lack of adequate internet infrastructure represents a major impediment to cultivating the capacity to more fully participate in the 21st century global economy and that the current digital divide constitutes an additional and persistent wedge between the fortunes of the developed and developing world this gap extends beyond physical infrastructure differences in both digital literacy and agency also pose obstacles to online engagement questions for the coming years include how well the combination of public and private investments in infrastructure national broadband policies technological advancement and education can help to bridge this gap and what the long term costs will be for those countries that do not for netizens that reside in well connected countries with restrictive online environments the infringement on political and civic liberties is a persistent issue with direct and indirect implications on social and economic development in addition to the acute human rights problems a point of central concern is that these restrictions inhibit the development of civil society institutions and social capital that are essential building blocks for modern societies to flourish yet identifying the most likely paths toward greater liberalization of digital spaces in autocratic regimes remains elusive the development and dissemination of tools that help users circumvent content filters protect internet resources from cyberattacks and aid in maintaining anonymity online help to create an environment for the politically active in authoritarian regimes where they can more freely express and share ideas it is less clear how this technologically driven and limited opening of internet spaces contributes in the long term to the reform of policies and regulations to protect internet openness a particular concern is that more countries will choose to take steps to further wall themselves off from the open internet a question for the coming year is whether russia will enforce proposed data localization policies and if they do how international social media and technology companies will respond there appears to be a real risk that russia will create a domestically hosted internet enclave similar to that found in china which would allow the government should it decide to do so to bring restrictions on digital media even closer in line to the controls on broadcast and print media a related question is how many other countries if able to do so would apply a chinese style censorship regime dialing up and down controls on political speech while allowing internet activity to thrive in other areas iran is an example of a country that has failed to create such an environment and instead has opted for crippling restrictions on internet activity although if ongoing attempts to add further controls are telling has also failed to impose the political control it seeks in those countries that show greater respect for freedom of expression and civil liberties online the regulatory fabric includes a mix of private ordering formal legal obligations and informal arrangements with companies and regulators alongside surreptitious activity much of which is illegal there are several trends that bear watching there appears to be growing support for clearly and proactively delineating internet rights this trend got a large boost from brazil when the legislature there passed the marco civil da internet it will be interesting to see how many other countries enact similar frameworks efforts to codify internet rights are underway in italy and france and appear to be indicative of a larger trend informed by more than 70 different proposals for defining fundamental rights online the mechanisms and structures for coordinating internet governance internationally may undergo significant changes in the coming year several forums are studying and discussing how to best forge global consensus on matters related to internet governance and how the various multistakeholder and multi lateral approaches can best contribute to global coordination another complex and important set of questions are teed up for countries that are committed to protecting free speech but also seek to address incursions into privacy and lessen the harms to citizens through damaging online activity such as defamation harassment misogyny racism threats of violence and other malicious attacks just as the efforts to protect internet rights may be contagious the policies and mechanisms used to curtail speech will be copied and emulated strategies to enforce a right to be forgotten online are from one perspective well justified and from another perspective deeply flawed in their implementation the search for and debate over alternative mechanisms to achieve similar results is underway and may influence the spread of such policies a similar set of trade offs will complicate any initiative to more aggressively police extremism online another issue to watch in the coming months and years is the many efforts to encrypt personal communications many people are working on this issue with renewed vigor and an increasing number of companies appear to view this issue as an important factor in their competitive standing the willingness of companies to be more aggressive in building encryption into their services as a default option will have the biggest impact on the speed and reach of diffusion the response by law enforcement agencies will also be interesting as they continue to take the argument that they been honing for many yearsthat unimpeded access to digital communication is essential for protecting the public from crime and terrorismto political leaders and the general public 
how europes new privacy rules affect entire digital economy after four years of negotiations the european parliament on thursday adopted sweeping privacy reforms that will not only change how the european union handles personal data but will have ripple effects across the entire global digital economy the general data protection regulation gdpr provides a single set of rules on internet privacy safeguards giving individuals vastly greater control over how their information is handled by both european and american tech companies in fact the data regulations which take effect in 2018 extend europeans so called right to be forgotten  a two year old policy that gives europeans the chance to erase their checkered past or erroneous posts from googles search results  to any type of international company such as data brokers or retailers that collects digital repositories of europeans personal data and companies that dont comply with the rules will face fines of up to 4 percent of their worldwide annual revenue or 20 million euros whichever is greater this is the biggest legislative development in data protection law worldwide for the last 20 years says christopher kuner codirector of the brussels privacy hub a privacy research center companies will have to get their house in order he says theyll be dealing with a much more complicated and strict set of requirements and even though there is a period of two years before it comes into force it really raises the stakes for companies the new data protection law will replace a previous rulebook that dates back to 1995 before widespread internet usage within the next two years businesses must be prepared not only to comply with the new rules but to develop new mechanisms such as transparency reports to show regulators they are abiding by the privacy regime additionally the regulations require companies to report data breaches within 72 hours and larger companies will have to employ data protection officers the data protection rules also come as europe is working to bolster data and information sharing in the wake of increasing migration to the continent and recent terrorist attacks in paris and brussels also this week the european parliament passed a law to allow airlines to share passenger information with eu members after resolving privacy restrictions that date back to 2011 the passenger name record system will require airlines to share passenger information such as itineraries means of payment and baggage information with authorities in eu destination countries even though europe is changing laws that had previously blocked some government surveillance efforts europe is still resistant to sharing information with us spy agencies earlier this week data protection watchdogs in europe sharply criticized a proposed data sharing plan known as privacy shield between the us and eu over surveillance concerns indeed the debate over increased data privacy versus national security is very much alive in europe the eu has to take a firmer stand on data protections says thomas lanson a researcher at the paris based french institute for international and strategic affairs but it also has to find a way to combine security measures and privacy protections 
eu open to digital competition official san francisco a top european union official on a tour that includes visits to us technology giants said the eu bloc is open to all players brushing aside references to digital protectionism our rules on a european level are relevant for everybody for european producers and players for asian players and for american players as well guenther oettinger the eu commissioner for the digital economy and society said in an interview late wednesday with afp and other media in san francisco its not protectionism its nothing against anybody its just to have less bureaucracy and more european clarity oettingers comments come amid growing complaints that the eu is discriminating against us tech firms by targeting them in probes on monopoly abuse privacy and tax evasion one major point of contention is the eu requirement that internet firms establish a right to be forgotten that allows people to erase inaccurate and outdated online information some in the us claim this amounts to censorship the eu earlier this year unveiled an ambitious plan to overhaul europes fragmented tech landscape to create a single digital market the rules aim to make online services available on a similar basis in all eu countries and also impose specific eu wide regulations oettinger said his ambition is to have one level of european general data protection regulation with some but not too many exceptions he added that this means having a smart level of rules which is good for privacy but which doesnt destroy big data services oettinger said he hopes to come to a common understanding with the united states on the right to be forgotten possibly in an international forum such as the organization for economic cooperation and development oettinger is on a five day us visit where he planned to meet top executives at facebook google apple and ebay he later heads to washington to meet policymakers and will then participate in the un broadband commission for digital development meeting in new york in a blog post ahead of his visit oettinger acknowledged that many in the us are worried that our aim with the digital single market is to benefit only european companies but added that the plan is about adapting the european economy to the digital age europeanising our digital policies and achieving a level playing field i have never been shy to point out that the european economy needs to adapt to the new realities that the internet and digital technologies have brought us he said there are questions that need to be answered on the power of these platforms the way they manage the enormous troves of data they collect and the potential harmful effects on competition and innovation that dominant players can have  afp 
eu parliament overhauls internet data protection rules  bangkok post tech strasbourg france   the european parliament on thursday adopted for the first time a single set of rules for the 28 nation eu to protect the privacy of people using the internet a demonstrator holds up a poster reading stop data preservation during a protest in berlin on april 18 2015 the reform replaces a patchwork of rules introduced two decades ago at the dawn of the internet age and boosts efforts by the european commission the eu executive to build a single digital market for 500 million people under the rules national watchdogs will be empowered to fine firms up to four percent of their total worldwide annual turnover if they are found to have broken eu wide data protection rules these new laws will ensure that the fundamental right to personal data protection is upheld for all european citizens the commissions first vice president frans timmermans said after the vote in strasbourg france and they will help stimulate the digital single market in the eu by fostering trust in online services by consumers and certainty for businesses timmermans added the new rules which took four years to hammer out include guarantees on the so called right to be forgotten google and brussels have previously clashed over this right which allows citizens to require search engines to erase results involving them after a period of time the new rules also give citizens the right to transfer their data to another service provider and to know when their information has been hacked while privacy policies must be explained to them clearly they are also designed to smoothen cooperation among law enforcement authorities a measure made more urgent with the recent attacks by jihadists in brussels and paris they set minimum standards for police to handle data within each member state as well as regulate police transfers of data across borders this reform is a great success for the european parliament and a fierce european yes to strong consumer rights and competition in the digital age said jan philipp albrecht a greens mep who steered the legislation through parliament citizens will be able to decide for themselves which personal information they want to share albrecht added the regulation will also create clarity for businesses by establishing a single law across the eu the new law creates confidence legal certainty and fairer competition brussels is seeking to extend the eu single market to the digital era europe as a bloc is the worlds biggest economy but despite its 500 million potential consumers it largely remains a divided continent of 28 distinct economies especially when it comes to media and the internet member states will have two years to turn the reforms provisions into law 
tough new privacy laws in eu could signal global changes it took four years but the european union thursday approved tough new privacy rules that give citizens rights to control their data and hangs the prospect of significant fines on companies who do not comply the general data protection regulation gdpr however will be eased into effect over the next two years it supplants the eus existing data protection directive dpd the eus 500 million citizens will have the right to tell companies to stop building profiles on them to move their data from one provider to another and have the right to be forgotten companies that collect and store data will face significant fines in case of misuse or breaches those fines will be up to 4 percent of the companys annual worldwide revenue or 20 million euros whichever is greater viviane reding the former vice president of the european commission said this is a historic day for europe this reform will restore trust in digital services today thereby reigniting the engine for growth tomorrow reding proposed the gdpr changes in 2012 proponents say the regulations offer strong personal data protection for eu citizens along with benefits for businesses that encourage growth in the eu economy data sharing between eu members proponents say will help law enforcement the regulations combine privacy by design concepts such as minimized data collection deletion of aging data restricted access and data lifecycle management its hardest line is perhaps its formula for fining those who violate the gdpr the question is can the new regulations create a new world standard the eu faces a challenge in balancing its privacy directives while maintaining innovation and investment in the eus tech market any global company doing business in the eu will be subject to the terms of the gdpr concern with the new rules has come from groups including the industry coalition for data protection icdp interactive advertising bureau europe iab european telecommunications network operators association etno and the confederation of british industry cbi icdp members include google facebook amazon and ibm all of which are concerned about chasing off investment in europes most innovative technologies eu officials have said companies will need to invest in new systems to accommodate gdpr directives and will need to establish management strategies to ensure compliance the eu itself will work to align the legislation among its 28 member states as the two year ramp up to the gdpr begins the next step is to overhaul the eus existing eprivacy directive to align it with changes brought by the gdpr 
forget about it the ecj ruling on the right to be forgotten is unworkable first for the casual observer it will give the false impression that you can now delete information on the internet about you that you dont like but the ruling only applies to the links to that information so rather than being forgotten the ruling allows that information to get lost but somehow the right to get lost makes for a far less appealing principle second it will raise huge uncertainties about who decides what should and shouldnt be deleted is that hotel review a malicious attempt to slur a respectable business  or a helpful warning for a hard working family looking for decent holiday accommodation do we really want our technology companies and service providers to be making judgments on the balance between free speech and privacy does information have to be of public interest for a search engine to link to it who is going to write the algorithm for that while all this confusion is going to be great for lawyers  legions of whom are working right now to try and unravel the implications of this ruling  it in no way will help europes growing digital businesses who need a clear and dependable legal and regulatory framework on which to build their businesses the uk is the worlds leading internet economy its success ironically perhaps for some has stemmed from the fact that a strong clear simple regulatory framework for ecommerce was put in place in europe in the 1990s based on the founding principle of mere conduit when laws and regulations are predictable and reliable businesses can flourish and we all benefit from the huge value of the innovation that flows as a result  services such as search engines and mobile applications provide huge economic value to all of us every day the challenge for industry governments and regulators today is to deliver similarly simple clear and dependable regulatory technical and commercial solutions to ensure that consumers feel empowered  and confident that they can live in a data driven world on their terms if there is one benefit from this weeks shock judgment it is that it hastens the need for all of us  industry politicians and regulators  to work towards real practical solutions that help consumers rather than grand sounding slogans julian david is the ceo of techuk  which represents more than 850 companies in the uk technology sector including google microsoft and ibm 
business not prepared for gdpr risking legal action and heavy financial penalties pwc comment commenting on the eus adoption of the general data protection regulation stewart room pwc partner and head of pwc legals data privacy and protection practice warned that business is not prepared for the complex legal changes to compliance and risks heavy financial penalties and a wave of litigation this landmark piece of legislation is important because of what it seeks to do by assisting people to gain more control over their personal data which is also a vital asset of the global economy the scale and breadth of the changes to privacy rules will deliver unprecedented challenges for business and every entity that holds or uses european personal data both inside and outside the eu most companies will be shocked at the scale of the new rules and the work that needs to be done before the laws take effect in two years   it is not much time for the magnitude of internal changes that will be required compliance costs will also be high in some cases tens of millions of pounds for large entities major retailers the banking sector and any entity that is aiming their marketing and promotion to consumers are especially at risk as is any entity that uses data around children technology companies will also be in the firing line with financial penalties of up to 4 of global annual turnover for non compliance some of our largest multinationals as well as public entities could face penalties worth many millions in pounds or euros as organisations are forced to publicly disclose any security and confidentiality breaches to the regulators and the people affected the new laws will go much further than reputational damage new enhanced rights for people over their personal data may also unleash a wave of legal action and compensation claims against entities that will face new rights including the right to be forgotten   so that personal data is deleted and destroyed by organisations obtaining consent to use personal data is also about to become a lot harder for companies as well as new requirements to assess the risks to personal data and privacy business will also face greater scrutiny from the european data protection regulators as new powers enable them to shape how personal data are used notes to editor stewart room is available for interview media contact lisa macnamara tel 0784 333 0907 or email lisamacnamaraukpwccom 
the european union is pushing new data protection laws european commissioner for competition margrethe vestager frederick florin  afp  getty images id 7598598 in a bid to protect consumers in an age of unprecedented data collection european officials moved tuesday to update a 20 year old privacy law granting eu citizens greater control over how tech companies collect their personal information the new data protection rules will cover europeans throughout the continents 28 member states replacing a patchwork of national laws the agreement compels companies like google and netflix to share with consumers how their data is collected and processed the regulations also codify the right to be forgotten which allows consumers to petition firms to delete outdated or irrelevant data stored about them citizens and businesses will profit from clear rules that are fit for the digital age said vera jourov the justice commissioner for the european unions executive arm in the event of a serious data breach the law would force companies to swiftly notify national authorities it also requires that consumers aged 1316 receive a parents permission before registering for social sharing services like instagram and snapchat for companies that violate the rules which do extend to silicon valley heavyweights doing business in europe penalties are high fines of up to 4 of a firms global revenue according to european policymakers the new data protection rules signal not only a commitment to consumer protection but an effort at keeping european tech companies globally competitive they are intended to help strengthen the eu economy for digital goods and services they say known as the digital single market the initiative was announced earlier this year we should not see privacy and data protection as holding back economic activities said andrus ansip the commissions vice president for the digital single market they are in fact an essential competitive advantage the american tech industry however may not share this vision europes privacy protections along with the single market are part of what some us business leaders believe is a harsh regulatory environment  protectionism disguised as consumer welfare facebook currently faces several privacy probes launched by authorities in germany france and belgium and the european commission leveled antitrust charges against google in april the european parliament and national governments are expected to adopt the final text of the law at the beginning of 2016 the rules will then take effect within two years 
digital currency putting blockchain regulations into the broader context of today 2015 was the year in which we finally saw financial regulators around the world sink their teeth into the dealings of digital currency and blockchain major developments include state based initiatives such as the bitlicense in new york new jerseys digital currency jobs creation act the european court of justices vat ruling declaring bitcoin conversions to be tax free and the sec announcing that certain mining contracts can be categorised as securities most of these efforts focused on setting jurisdictional boundaries and ensuring the technologies could not be misappropriated for illicit purposes this trend for increased regulatory engagement is set to continue throughout 2016 as we begin to see the impact of these initial measures and additional jurisdictions and overseers enter the fray as the sector matures it will be interesting to see how governments treat blockchain solutions such as r3cev chain and digital asset holdings aimed at bringing our trading and settlement industries into the 21st century steve ehrlich an associate at spitzberg partners however despite advocates faith in bitcoin and the blockchain its long term future is not as a means of payment there are many reasons to be frustrated with our monetary system  high costs inefficient infrastructure exposure to poor government policy as seen in venezuela brazil and greece for example  but more often than not these faults are not enough to compel the everyman to eschew traditional currency therefore aside from blockchain solutions for our financial markets the best case scenarios for blockchains killer app would be found in consumer applications and back end corporate systems however operators in these categories face entirely different regulatory regimes from those in the financial world as their businesses are increasingly dependent on the use of personal data firms moving to these verticals will need to understand and appreciate these unique challenges and constraints in order to succeed recent years have seen an explosion of personal data as a result companies across all industries are increasingly becoming digitised collecting more information about their clients and employees to optimise their businesses and increase profitability however as consumers becomes increasingly aware of just how much companies know about them they are realising that they are not getting equitable value in return and are beginning to demand a recalibration of these relationships and additional control over the use of theirdata in response to this shift in public opinion in large part spurred on by the snowden revelations a different set of regulators are starting to respond as well from those we typically associate with the crypto ecosystem ones focused on the terms data privacy and data security these are the challenges that keep executives across all industries up at night as they worry about managing relationships with regulators and customers alike as they dip their toes into the blockchain with a proof of concept or pilot project they know full well that any large roll out would be predicated upon clearance from their regulatory team this will not be an easy bar to clear key data privacy and data security terms data privacy governs how personal data is used shared and retained data security however relates to efforts aimed at restricting access to sensitive data and protecting it from being viewed during its collection storage and transmission data protection regulations typically begin with identifying the data controller and data subject according to the european union the data controller is a natural or legal person public authority agency or any other body that alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data the data subject is the person to which a set of personal data applies the foundation of todays data protection laws there are no globally administered data protection laws the closest thing to a set of standards that exists today is the oecds privacy principles  established in 1980 the guidelines which have influenced the shape of regulations around the world put forth eight principles in sum prescribing that companies collect information necessary for a given purpose be transparent about data processing appropriately safeguard information and allow people to see and correct data that has been obtained from them but even within the bounds of these widely accepted tenets there is room for divergence for example the european union and us  two seemingly similar economic units based on size free market values and stage of development  took distinctly different approaches to data protection regulation the eu home to the first data protection law in the world is the standard bearer for the comprehensive approach wherein one law and data protection authority covers all sectors and data processing within a given economy on the other hand the us has no overarching data protection law but instead uses a sectoral approach specific regulations and regulators are mandated to safeguard each sector of the economy  healthcare finance and such  with the goal of customising given requirements based on the unique characteristics of each industry differences in approach can cause serious issues for companies that have clients in multiple jurisdictions or who outsource some processing activities such as hr or payroll to third parties in different countries additionally if this was not challenging enough these regulatory environments are in the midst of their most dynamic period in history just last month eu regulators finally agreed on a text for a new data protection law entitled the general data protection regulation which has been in discussion since 2012 crucially if passed this law would impose many new conditions on companies that handle personal data such as increased consent requirements from data subjects a broader right to be forgotten a 72 hour company breach notification requirement data portability requirements and most critically higher fines up to 4 of global turnover in the us the federal trade commission ftc is taking on an increasing role of policing the data driven activities of companies under section 5 of the federal trade commission act ftc act 15 usc 45 which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in application the ftc uses its authority under this article to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by data driven companies as a recent example the ftc is making cyber security a major priority pursuing companies that did not have adequate security tools and procedures in place in fact in late 2015 ftc commissioner edith ramirez reiterated to startups and small and medium sized businesses the importance of cyber security integration within their businesses at the outset despite admitting that the economic incentives may not always be in alignment the bottom line at this point in time companies are entering a period of unprecedented regulatory scrutiny and penalties across all sectors enterprises are now required to have a much greater awareness of their data inventory be transparent with how they collect and use it and include additional consumer protections throughout their operations this is where the blockchain smart data and smart contracts come in this confluence of regulatory attention and changing customer preferences creates a perfect storm for the growth of a blockchain based economy blockchains smart contracts and intelligent data can all be used to add granularity to personal data encode permissions conditions and regulatory restrictions in short they can build accountability into a firms data management procedures in addition the technology offers a signature advantage from a security point in that it eliminates the threat of a single point of failure additionally the threat of an insider attack is similarly lessened through the implementation of multi sig technology further company information can be hashed on to the blockchain in order to create immutable and time stamped records for your company information assisting with auditing or business continuity procedures questions and uncertainty remain regulators are studying blockchain technology for its merits but have yet to devote a level of focus on par with other major platforms such as search engines and social media this is easy to understand given the technologys moderate stature to date and they are trying to handle the googles and facebooks of the world until adequate attention is afforded to the sector operators in this space would be operating under a cloud of uncertainty for the foreseeable future fortunately this lag presents an opportunity for key players in the space to establish and promote industry specific best practices for safe transparent ethical and most importantly equitable business operations the intent is to avoid creating a situation that would catch the attention of regulators which could challenge widespread adoption governments are overstretched so they will certainly appreciate someone making their lives easier additionally this type of work will make company conversations easier with regulators once the time comes since they can show their efforts to be proactive responsible corporate citizens this process known as technological regulation would see responsible trade groups come together and create sets of standards and principles to which they pledge to adhere and possibly establish mechanisms for self oversight truste and the international advertising bureau offer a proven model for success on this front from advocacy groups such as coin center and the chamber of digital commerce to the wall street blockchain alliance and digital asset transfer authority there are already groups taking on leadership positions additionally new initiatives and offerings such as ibms open ledger project and microsofts azure blockchain as a service present other interesting initiatives it would be a good move for these organisations to begin focusing on these issues as they interact with regulators and develop new products at the end of the day each company and individual will have to identify solutions that work best for them and conduct rigorous due diligence based on their specific business operations and jurisdictions additionally the optimal solution continues to be a moving target as regulations change however these steps are worth it because blockchain based applications and systems offer an intriguing way for companies to create a more equitable relationship with clients lower their risk profile and grow a business with confidence steve ehrlich is an associate at spitzberg partners a boutique corporate advisory and investment firm headquartered in new york that provides strategic

new european ruling game changing for us companies the google logo is seen at the google headquarters in brussels photo virginia mayo ap europes highest court ruling tuesday that people have the right to be forgotten and can ask google to remove some sensitive information from internet search results is huge privacy experts say the ruling is groundbreaking said trevor hughes president and ceo of the international association of privacy professionals individuals now have the ability to essentially go in with a virtual black marker and redact their names hughes said it will fundamentally change the landscape not only in the field of privacy but also in the information economy generally hughes said the judgment was handed down by the luxembourg based court of justice of the european union in a development that highlights ongoing battles between supporters of privacy rights and those who advocate for freedom of expression the court ruled that google if asked to do so must amend links to information shown to be outdated or information deemed to be irrelevant an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties the judges added the case followed complaints from a man in spain who argued that when googles search results revealed details published in a local newspaper about an auction of his repossessed home that infringed on his privacy rights its a very powerful statement in support of privacy said marc rotenberg executive director of the electronic privacy information center in washington dc its going to create additional burdens for google and other companies he said but thats the cost of doing business if your business involves disseminating information he said the ruling stated that the individuals fundamental rights override the economic interest of the operator of the search engine but also the interest of the general public in having access to that information google expressed disappointment with the decision this is a disappointing ruling for search engines and online publishers in general the search engine giant said in a statement we now need to take time to analyze the implications the technology firm had argued that it doesnt control personal data it just offers links to information already freely and legally available on the internet the european high court effectively said that any company that gathers or indexes information about european citizens is subject to its laws even if the company has no physical presence in that nation because the information is being presented in that country via the internet said hughes dealing with these kinds of requests will cost money but google and other search companies already perform similar operations for example in the matter of copyright infringement they routinely take down youtube videos they dont like the burden of having to do it but if youre going to offer videos youve got to said rotenberg viviane reding the eus justice commissioner who is on leave from her post while she campaigns for re election to the european parliament said todays court judgment is a clear victory for the protection of personal data of europeans the comments were posted on redings facebook page ruth collard an expert on media law at london based legal firm carter ruck said the ruling might have particular relevance to young people who find that something embarrassing posted in their school or student days has continuing repercussions as they grow older any company that indexes or aggregates information any company that provides chat rooms or discussion services or review sites  they should be having discussions today about how they might implement scrubbing services if they get one of these take down notices hughes said the court did not set up exact requirements for how this must take place what its going to look like still remains unclear some find its breadth disturbing the decision is staggering said fred cate who directs the center for applied cybersecurity research at indiana university in bloomington ind it gives europeans the right to demand removal of a link even if it is an accurate publications of newsworthy events that is true concerns a matter of public interest and does not otherwise violate any national law he said fordham law professor joel reidenberg an expert on information law and privacy says a us court would likely treat search results differently citing a section of the telecommunications act that would give a company such as google immunity from being responsible for content on their service read or share this story httpusatly1gi0xcb 
eu data protection law reform criticised on data privacy day january 28 2014 the european commissions forthcoming data protection law reforms have been heavily criticised on data privacy day privacy the european union has been battling for 18 months to make changes to the continents data laws which have remain unchanged since 1995 ahead of todays data privacy day eu justice commissioner viviane reding once again called for the eu data protection reform which could see businesses lose as much as 5 percent of annual revenue  or up to 100 million approximately 822 million  in the event of a data breach two years ago on 25 january 2012 a great debate began in europe said reding in a prepared statement a debate about data protection in a world of total connectivity about privacy in a world where data flows across borders as easily as the air we breathe about the future of the digital economy 9 months ago the debate took an unexpected turn the first stories about prism were published since then headlines have been dominated by stories about government surveillance in my dialogues with citizens across the union the sense of shock was palpable we have learned that the times of mass surveillance are not relegated to the past data collection by companies and surveillance by governments these issues are connected not separate the surveillance revelations involve companies whose services we all use on a daily basis backdoors have been built encryption has been weakened concerns about government surveillance drive consumers away from digital services from a citizens perspective the underlying issue is the same in both cases data should not be kept simply because storage is cheap data should not be processed simply because algorithms are refined safeguards should apply and citizens should have rights the pan euro reform a topic of debate at the recent international cybersecurity forum  has been subject to plenty of criticism in recent months with many blaming vague terminology and various legal loopholes a recent ico study also revealed a lack of it understanding around the changes for reding though she says that change is imminent discussions are mature the text is ready it is just a matter of political will any changes will see the statutory 1995 directive replaced with a single regulation which is expected to be fully ratified by 2015 which will be applicable to all 28 eu member states the law requires companies notify the appropriate authorities within 24 hours of a breach and also demands that firms do not share european citizen data with authorities of another country unless explicitly allowed by eu law or international treaty from the citizens perspective the law  which still needs approval    will give them easier access to service provider data as well as the right to be forgotten sam maccherola general manager of the emeaapac at guidance software  which has trained more than 50000 cyber investigators told scmagazineukcom that the law may be of limited value to businesses businesses now recognise breaches and rogue employees to be inevitable increasing fines and notification requirements over the coming months are a stimulus to better stewardship of data   and when the inevitable happens preparedness to detect triage remediate and report but even without the demands of forthcoming european law and the enforcement of a harmonised regime cios and ceos already know that a data breach could cost them a substantial proportion of turnover said maccherola as a major uk retailer i wouldnt wait for compliance to tell me to protect my customers and my brand id be doing it now christian toon head of information risk at storage and information management solution provider iron mountain added that most companies are unlikely to tighten security policies and data protection guidelines however steep the fine despite the fact that this is a huge and potentially devastating sum of money it remains unlikely that the threat will encourage firms to tighten their security policies and overhaul their data protection guidelines toon told scmagazineukcom this is not the first time this 5 per cent penalty has been proposed the past three years have witnessed much discussion in brussels around the possibility of increasing fines and clamping down harder on firms that suffer a data breach however no concrete proposal has yet been put into effect as a consequence many firms are not taking sufficient steps to secure themselves against a data breach and few have shown any real commitment to building a company wide culture of information responsibility that is led from the top the eu law reform has been heavily influenced by the leaks from former cia contractor edward snowden and these latest concerns were raised on data privacy day which is also today 28th january martin sugden ceo of boldon james said that this latest initiative could change perceptions around data security awareness days are a great way to raise the profile of important issues that might otherwise go unnoticed and data privacy day on 28 th january is no different he told scmagazineukcom data privacy day is a great initiative to highlight and educate businesses on the importance of good data security practices but the responsibility for educating staff will always remain firmly in the hands of the company technologies that empower users to take ownership of secure practices such as data classification will help organisations succeed where so many others have failed 
eu needs a single telco regulator says googles top policy wonk europe needs a single telco regulator if over the top providers are to flourish across the continent googles public policy manager of emea theo bertram has said speaking at a westminster forum event bertram said the long awaited update to european telecommunications framework must take into account otts of which google is one every successful ott needs to be global they cant be local the challenge for european start ups and developers is if we start making it harder to scale up wont compete globally he said we dont have one regulator across europe and it is harder to argue country by country regulations is going to be good for the economy his remarks follow calls by two eu committees last month that that the eus telecoms market should be regulated by a single authority bertram said that unlike traditional telcos google faces a greater regulatory burden i want to dispel the myth that we are unregulated we have many regulations that bear down on us he named compliance with right to be forgotten and obligations on privacy and data asked to name the biggest regulatory hurdle facing the company he said it is much less about uk regulation and increasingly about european regulations the telecoms frameworks is a challenge bertram also dismissed the argument that ott providers are free riding on telcos infrastructure investment   pointing to the companys spend on data centres and undersea cables he said the company did not want to become the worlds internet service provider as that was not as profitable as its core business were not going to see google fiber coming to europe anyone looking at europe would see a market more competitive so it would be harder to deliver given levels of competition here he also said it would be extremely unlikely that the companys project loon  intended to provide wi fi via hot air balloons to unconnected parts of the world  would come to the uk last time one did we had to warn the mod not to shoot it down he said  sponsored hpc in the cloud a solution for varied computing needs 
with european data rules come a need for a cop with european data rules come a need for a cop by mark scott may 26 2014 london  the new european parliament that was voted into office over the weekend despite having a different political makeup is widely expected to reach a final agreement later this year on stricter online privacy rules that have long been in the works the rules as shaped over the last three years would be stricter than those in the united states they would create one law across the continent to protect several aspects of online privacy which is enshrined as a fundamental right in europe including restrictions on what information can be shipped overseas and they would slap multimillion dollar fines on any company that misuses europeans data still a crucial question remains up for debate which european regulator will have the final say over enforcing the rules under the proposals companies will be able to operate throughout the continent if they fulfill the requirements  and interpretation  of european rules from only one countrys privacy authority the companies currently must comply with the regulator in each of the 28 countries of the european union in which they do business lawmakers in favor of the proposals say that leaving the oversight with one countrys office gives companies more clarity about the rules but consumer groups in europe have warned that if the current proposal stands tech companies  including american giants like microsoft amazon and google  could set up shop in the european country with the most lenient data privacy interpretation this issue has become more political than technical said raegan macdonald european policy manager for the digital rights group access in brussels she added who gets to decide on these matters is very important the law is expected to be finished in the first half of 2015 it has gained momentum since the revelations from edward j snowden the former national security agency contractor about the spying activities of american and british intelligence agencies before the rules go into effect though each of the european unions 28 countries still must reach a final agreement with the european commission the unions executive arm and the european parliament the proposals build on existing rules from the 1990s providing citizens with greater control over what data is collected where it is kept and which companies and governments have access to it the rules also restrict what information can be sent to countries that do not replicate europes data protection laws to police the new rules international companies with european customers even if they do not have offices on the continent would have to comply with the strengthened controls or face fines totaling 2 percent to 5 percent of global revenues or 137 million whichever is greater the reforms in europe will affect companies global operations said wim nauwelaerts a data protection partner at the law firm hunton  williams in brussels the fines are europes big stick to ensure people take this seriously faced with the prospect of tougher privacy rules companies like facebook and ebay have lobbied hard since the proposals were first outlined in 2012 to limit the legislations impact saying europe is creating strict laws that make it difficult for companies to invest in the continents lackluster economy industry groups have raised fears that the new laws would add costs as companies must explicitly ask users on a regular basis how their data is used and limit what information is sent to countries that do not comply with europes privacy rules yet companies have supported the changes that give one regulator sole control over interpreting european rules that they say adds regulatory certainty because companies will be responsible to just one authority across the continent were concerned that the new rules will remain as fragmented as they are today but it will cost more to comply said john higgins director general of digital europe a trade body in brussels whose members include microsoft and apple some national governments however have balked at these changes countries like germany believe their domestic privacy rules which are some of the most stringent in the world may be watered down if other regulators gain greater control european lawmakers also have criticized the rules because citizens may not have the money or even the language skills to bring complaints against companies in other european countries already questions about who monitors and regulates online privacy are bubbling to the surface two weeks ago the continents highest court ruled that people could demand that google take down links to information about them on the internet this so called right to be forgotten which is an important part of europes new data protection legislation allows individuals  both citizens of european union nations and potentially others as well  to force global tech companies to remove links to their past activities as long as people are not deemed to be public figures like celebrities or politicians analysts say the legal decision will force google and other search companies to field a wave of new complaints as people request that online links be taken down but the ruling must be carried out by data privacy regulators at 28 different agencies across the european union which could lead to jurisdiction shopping data protection cant survive on a national level said peter schaar a former federal data protection commissioner in germany we need to have an international approach if the final privacy decisions will eventually rest with an individual regulator many consumer groups expect ireland to become the de facto arbiter on privacy matters for the continent many american tech companies are based there because of the countrys low tax rates and digital rights advocates say that ireland is already known for taking a more moderate view on online privacy issues than regulators in countries like germany and france others have called on individual countries regulators to continue to play a role by acting as intermediaries between individuals and the privacy authority that holds the main responsibility for policing each company that industry lobbyists say may lead to national regulators continuing to vie for control over privacy matters despite regulatory efforts to make it easier to deal with individual complaints whatever the outcome over who makes the final rules european politicians are sure that their policies will still have more bite than the existing rules  and those currently on the books in the united states lobbyists need to understand that were creating a global digital standard said jan philipp albrecht a german politician who is a leading supporter of the new privacy rules this is important for all of our citizens 
us government still leaning on europe to dilute data protection reform proposals the us government is continuing to lobby brussels to water down plans to reform privacy legislation the european unions executive and legislative bodies are in the process of reforming the regions data protection rules  a long overdue wrangle since current legislation dates back to 1995 when facebook was not even a gleam in 11 year old mark zuckerbergs eye the europe commission proposed new rules last january  setting out its intention to harmonize data protection rules across eu member states by establishing a single national data protection authority and also give citizens more control over their data including granting people the right to have data that companies and organisations hold on them deleted on request a so called right to be forgotten and a right to have their data ported to another service data holders would also have to notify service users of serious data breaches  if feasible within 24 hours other proposals include requirements for companies to have a data protection officer to oversee compliance the new rules would apply to any companies and organisations processing eu citizens data  even if they are entirely based outside the eu to enforce the new rules the ec is proposing to strengthen independent national data protection authorities including giving them the ability to fine companies up to 1 million 127 million or up to 2 percent of their global annual turnover the proposals have now reached the european parliament committee debate stage with draft reports produced by committee rapporteurs last week theres still a way to go before agreement is reached between all 27 eu member states enabling new legislation to be adopted  so there is still time for lobbyists to keep aggitating european digital and civil rights association the edri  has obtained a copy of what is purported to be the latest us government lobby document online here   a document which calls on europe to be more flexible in its approach and warns that the reforms risk stifling innovation and growth and jeopardizing the free flow of information needed to fight crime and terrorism the document warns it goes on to urge that the proposals be revised to ensure that security and commerce are not adversely affected the general thrust of the argument set out in the document is that the us does not want to be beholden to european policy decisions on privacy  favouring interoperability of respective privacy frameworks theres also an implied threat that trade and commerce between the us and europe could suffer if the reforms themselves are not reformed interoperability of our respective privacy regimes is critical to maintaining our extraordinary economic relationship fostering trade and preventing non tariff barriers and unlocking the full potential for our economic innovation and growth the document states we urge the eu to look more toward outcomes that provide meaningful protection for privacy and focus less on formalistic requirements the document which runs to five pages goes on to address specific portions of the proposed eu legislation  arguing that standards developed through voluntary consensus based multi stakeholder processes are a better alternative to regulation where the internet is concerned as they are more flexible and adaptable to a quickly changing technological environment it also argues that user consent for use of personal data need not always be express affirmative consent and that the scope of consent based options that are offered to users should correlate with the scale scope and sensitivity of the personal data that organizations collect use or disclose on the right to be forgotten and the right to erasure the us warns the eu to make modifications to avoid hampering the ability to innovate compete and participate in the global economy for example we suggest that the eu reconsider the feasibility of placing obligations on a data controller for publications made by others after consent is withdrawn it notes going on to voice concerns that rights to freedom of expression might suffer under the current proposals the document also argues that the proposed 24 hours data breach notification law is not a long enough period for organizations to comply  and might also lead to over notifications causing consumers to ignore them or act unnecessarily on erroneous information a very large portion of the document is given over to concerns about the impact of the proposals on the global transfer of data and free flow of information  with the us lobbyists apparently arguing that eu proposals could have disastrous ramifications for regulators law enforcement authorities and litigants in civil cases assuming the document is genuine it suggests the us government is continuing to lobby brussels to dilute its proposals last october techweekeurope reported that the us chamber of commerce was lobbying european politicians to alter the proposed new rules on behalf of the us government adam schlosser senior manager for global regulatory cooperation at the chamber of commerce told the publication it had been engaged in lobbying since march with a taskforce of around 50 staff engaged on the issue some of the biggest concerns are providing flexibility for different business models allowing for compliance with existing legal obligations such as anti fraud both in the eu and in third countries and actually creating a one stop shop that is predictable and consistent across member states schlosser told techweekeurope in october he described progress as incremental adding the business community will need sustained and continued efforts to develop a pragmatic approach that considers how a final regulation can actually work in the real world at the time of writing the us chamber of commerce had not responded to a request for an update on its current position regarding the eu privacy reforms facebook has also been lobbying europe about the reforms  with its own smaller team of lobbyists based in brussels  calling aspects of the proposals such as the right to be forgotten unreasonable and unrealistic but its not just big tech companies that are voicing opposition act  the association for competitive technology  an international non profit associationadvocacy group for startup sized small and medium sized businesses such as mobile software developers  has also been lobbying brussels on aspects of the reform that it believes would have a negative impact on startup businesses in the region the commission views startups as lifeforms that dont communicate with bigger businesses eu spokesman for act greg polad told techcrunch a particular bone of contention for act is that the latest amendments to the proposals  in the european parliament draft committee reports  removed prior exemptions for smes to employ a data protection officer replacing it with an exemption for companies that deal with fewer than 500 data pointssubjects a limit polad describes as ridiculously small another admin and cost burden that smes could face as a result of the proposed legislation is a requirement for a business to pre emptively conduct privacy impact assessments if it deals with certain types of data  an up front cost which polad argues could disuade startups from trying to build their businesses in europe if youre saying to startups you have x y and z costs to think about before you start operating then youre not helping them to enter the market and youre most definitely not helping them to innovate and try and test out and experiment on the market he argues 
list of bbc web pages which have been removed from googles search results since a european court of justice ruling last year individuals have the right to request that search engines remove certain web pages from their search results those pages usually contain personal information about individuals following the ruling google removed a large number of links from its search results  including some to bbc web pages and continues to delist pages from bbc online update 290615 google has asked us to point out that links to the bbc articles below are only delisted from results for queries on certain names they are not removed from the google index entirely were happy to make that clear the bbc has decided to make clear to licence fee payers which pages have been removed from googles search results by publishing this list of links each month well republish this list with new removals added at the top we are doing this primarily as a contribution to public policy we think it is important that those with an interest in the right to be forgotten can ascertain which articles have been affected by the ruling we hope it will contribute to the debate about this issue we also think the integrity of the bbcs online archive is important and although the pages concerned remain published on bbc online removal from google searches makes parts of that archive harder to find the pages affected by delinking may disappear from google searches but they do still exist on bbc online david jordan the bbcs director of editorial policy and standards has written a blog post which explains how we view that archive as a matter of historic public record and thus something we alter only in exceptional circumstances the bbcs rules on deleting content from bbc online are strict in general unless content is specifically made available only for a limited time the assumption is that what we publish on bbc online will become part of a permanently accessible archive to do anything else risks reducing transparency and damaging trust setting out that view and so as to be as transparent as possible the bbc has published guidance on the removal of content from its services  and ive written previously about how we manage bbc onlines archive one caveat when looking through this list it is worth noting that we are not told who has requested the delisting and we should not leap to conclusions as to who is responsible the request may not have come from the obvious subject of a story

is google working the right to be forgotten system video some industry watchers claim google might be indirectly fighting the eu ruling under the eus new right to be forgotten anyone can petition google to have irrelevant or misleading content removed from its indexing services this doesnt remove the content itself just googles listing and its only from certain eu google domains  searches from say the us google site can turn up some of those blacklisted results all the same objection has been swift and dire bgr worries the new system is ripe for abuse and already trending toward censorship the guardian stuck an asterisk on the concept of a google search now you see the most important information the target of your search is not trying to hide but theres a new argument being floated by some industry watchers  that google is just as disillusioned with the whole idea as everyone else and is playing by the rules to call attention to just how absurd they are via flickr  carlos luna  those deleted links after all are getting plenty of coverage  especially from those organizations that lose out on traffic as a result six of the guardians own articles were blocked this way the idea some outlets would suggest is to get journalists organizations and the public on its side  and in the process turn an indirect spotlight on the links its deleting through the right to be forgotten via softpedia  peter barron director of google communications for europe talked to bbc radio 4 this is new territory for us all we opposed the ruling there is no right of appeal in the european court of justice but we think its important to have a public debate about this its a very very important issue but google is stopping short of admitting to forcing the issue by proxy of public outcry  a tactic some including danny sullivan at search engine land  think is too roundabout anyway if google wanted to gum up the works it could have rejected all requests that would have put huge pressure on privacy regulators to deal with this situation which in turn would have put huge pressure on various eu governments on how they really wanted to enforce this court mandate google didnt do that google has fielded more than 70000 requests for removal since the ruling came down in may  which google reps say amount to a quarter million individual links to content 
google readies tool for deleting search results people will be able to use an online tool to ask google not to display search results about them according to a german data protection commissioner google will create the tool following a decision by the court of justice of the european union cjeu which ruled on tuesday that google and other search engines can be ordered to delete links to outdated information about a person published on the internet european citizens that want to be forgotten by search engines can file a request directly with the search engine operator to have out of date information about them deleted the operator must determine if the information displayed about the person in its search results is still relevant and if not must remove it from the results the court ruled in order to deal with these requests google plans to release an online tool to implement a procedure for a right to be forgotten or rather for the right not to be found said johannes caspar hamburgs commissioner for data protection the system will include an authentication mechanism to prevent unauthorized takedown requests he added google already offers semi automated tools for requesting that limited categories of personal information such as signatures national identification numbers or bank account details be removed from its search results but those will need to be expanded the ruling has significant implications for how we handle takedown requests a google spokesman said in an email declining to comment on how the system would work exactly this is logistically complicated    not least because of the many languages involved and the need for careful review as soon as we have thought through exactly how this will work which may take several weeks we will let our users know he said he could not say if the amount of takedown requests has increased since the ruling caspar called for data protection authorities dpas in europe to consider harmonizing their criteria for the deletion of a link in a search engine in the interest of an equal treatment of all european citizens especially the search engine providers there should be coherent principles amongst all dpas in europe he added frances dpa the national commission on computing and liberty cnil said friday that the court ruling confirms its existing interpretation of french law and that it stands ready to enforce the ruling in france if google does not respond satisfactorily to requests meanwhile other european dpas including the irish office of the data protection commissioner dpc the uks information commissioners office ico and the norwegian data protection authority are still reviewing the verdict and its possible implications google has been discussing the implications of the judgement with the irish and the norwegian agencies though as far as i understand they have not decided how they will cope with these takedown requests in the nordics said bjarn erik thon norways data protection commissioner people who want references to them deleted from google would first have to file a request with google directly paula nerney senior investigations officer of the irish dpc said in an email data protection authorities should become involved if an individuals request made to google is not satisfied she said loek is amsterdam correspondent and covers online privacy intellectual property open source and online payment issues for the idg news service follow him on twitter at loekessers or email tips and comments to loek_essersidgcom 
what you need to know about the right to be forgotten on google who decides your rights to privacy and freedom of speech on the internet earlier this month a landmark ruling by europes biggest court left google trying to find an answer to that unanswerable question the case which centers on the so called right to be forgotten allows european users to actively ask providers to remove personal information thats become outdated or irrelevant even if google or other search engines has indexed it in a fair and legal way its obligated to comply with the ruling its opened a debate over whether a company known for its complex search algorithms should be given the duty of making judgement calls over what should and should not remain online for the world to see google co founder sergey brin wishes he could just forget the ruling but unfortunately for him google and you  the issue is real and its going to impact the way we search the web forever it began in 2010 with a spanish lawyer named mario costeja gonzlez gonzlez complained to the spanish data protection agency that google had indexed pages in a spanish newspaper which announced an auction notice had been placed on his home in 1998 he wanted both google and the newspaper to remove the offending pages or at least conceal the damaging information they contained the pages ranked highly against searches on his name which he argued infringed on his right to privacy as those events happened over a decade ago he contended that they were no longer relevant to his current situation googles response was to staunchly oppose costeja resist pressure from spains privacy regulator and ignore rulings by its national high court google said such actions amounted to censorship the spanish newspaper however escaped further action because it was protected under its press rights googles refusal to comply saw the case referred to the european court of justice for a tougher examination on may 13th the court of justice arrived at a decision unexpectedly it decided that costejas right to be forgotten outweighed the importance google places on linking to publicly available information deeming the search giant a data controller the court told google it needs to provide users with an option to erase search results that are inadequate irrelevantor excessive but also outdated right now thats anyones guess google said shortly after the judgement was passed that it needed to analyze the implications of that decision because like us its likely confused by what it actually needs to do with such broad terms    excessive or even outdated    developing a structured ruleset here for what will and wont be taken down is going to be extremely tough in the weeks following the ruling google has been inundated with thousands of takedown requests among those thousands are naturally some dubious requests one such request was from a doctor seeking to remove negative reviews of his work another from a politician seeking re election who wants to cover up his past and another from a convicted criminal aiming to wipe his past sins for its part google must respond to each request the companys search team which normally focuses on making the service artificially intelligent is being forced to take a more human approach theyve been given the task of deciding whether requests from the doctor the politician the criminal    and everyone else    have merit as it stands google has nothing but impossibly vague inadequate irrelevant excessive and outdated definitions to guide it also bear in mind that the information will still exist on the websites that published the original information google just wont be able to deliver matches to some queries that you enter thats to say the information isnt being erased from the web just made less easily searchable germany keen advocate of privacy and a challenger of facebook  is currently mulling over whether to set up arbitration courts to help decide what information people can force google to remove from its listings whether it agrees with the decision or not it believes googles algorithms shouldnt have the final say why should i care in the past if you wanted to access published information youd head to a library of office of public record and access their archives the internet makes it much easier to find categorize and index late last week google made its first move to comply with the european court adding a right to be forgotten form for europeans to begin submitting removal claims submissions require the standard logistical stuff like names and email addresses and a photo id like a passport or driving license beyond that things get personal  an explanation on how each linked page is related to you and why the search result is irrelevant outdated or otherwise inappropriate whichever way google decides to play things european lawmakers cant expect non eu countries to adopt the same approach googles already confirmed that links will be removed only for search results presented in the eu meaning even the most non savvy of surfers will be able to surface uncensored results by using a non eu version of a search engine in an eu country theres also the possibility that some companies will create new search engines that exist simply to surface information that others have done their best to cover up while the court of justices ruling is legally binding and cannot be revoked theres still plenty to sort out the article 29 data protection working party a group of representatives from the data protection authority in each eu member state meets in the coming weeks to discuss how the ruling will be enforced its important for the article 29 group to agree on a common way to handle the requests because theyre the ones likely to be asked to deal with any complaints if google or any other search provider doesnt do what is asked of it while googles launched its online tool it hasnt said what will happen to those listings when they are de indexed censoring results isnt new to google it already complied with requests to remove torrent listings for pirated media instead of removing all traces of a copyright infringing result it keeps a level of transparency by displaying a notice where that result would have been highlighting that the company has complied with the law you could say that the little notice shows its not particularly happy to have had its hand forced google may choose to do the same for forgotten requests letting you know if a person has asked for you not to see information related to them it will be used by other governments that arent as forward and progressive as europe to do bad things   larry page because it was the company at the center of the investigation google will forge a path that its rivals will almost certainly follow its working with article 29 to agree on best practices meaning youll likely see the same processes put in place on bing yahoo and other search engines to best decide the route to take google has set up its own advisory committee including a un expert on freedom of speech a philosopher at the oxford internet institute a law expert from the university of leuven an academic who used to work for spains data protection agency the irony and jimmy wales co founder of wikipedia google executive chairman eric schmidt and the companys top legal advisor david drummond co chair the committee opinion remains divided over how the right to be forgotten will affect free speech google profits from collecting and selling data related to its users so opponents say it can afford to cede some control back to the people by letting them decide what data can be seen theres also been some very vocal opposition to the ruling some suggest that googles filtering of search results affects freedom of communication and a persons right to educate themselves about other people as the internet evolves laws have  slowly  adapted to protect the rights of web users whether content is posted to facebook twitter or on a personal blog the right to be forgotten ruling sidesteps existing legal processes and makes google responsible for the content that appears in its results expanding its role from an aggregator to an editor in some ways the ruling puts more power in the hands of google and european legal institutions the power to administer censorship in other ways it empowers the people who want to be forgotten but the web works on a flow of information and when the balance is tipped in either direction its the mainstream users in the middle who are most likely to lose out if youd like to know more about the eu case you can read the full ruling here perhaps youd like to dig into how this decision impacts your digital rights the wall street journal has a great article that does just that the guardian also has a very detailed qa piece that delves deep into the how the eu arrived at its decision and what it means for you image credit ap photoyves logghe european

how googles new right to be forgotten form works an explainer google has taken a big step forward in complying with the european unions new  right to be forgotten  that was established after a court ruling earlier this month how the form works googles right to be forgotten form what happens after submission heres the response that google sends out thanks for reaching out to us once we have our system up and running well process your request as quickly as our workload permits regards the google team removals only happen in the eu for eu versions of google removals will be disclosed heres an example of how that looks for a copyright removal action in the us what type of material will get removed a politician who behaved badly a business with bad reviews someone convicted of having child pornography were some of the requests as we covered in our earlier story google said we could cite the stats as well of the requests made to have material removed from google uk and google ireland the leading reason is to have material about a fraud or scam incident dropped followed by urls for arrests for violent or serious crime followed by child pornography arrests 31 fraudscam incident removals 20 violentserious crime arrest removals 12 child pornography arrest removals but france which has nearly as many people as germany makes up only a tiny percentage of the requests 40 germany the eus most populous country 80 million people 14 spain 13 uk 3 italy 2 france the eus second most populous country 67 million people making the judgment calls  the advisory committee heres googles official statement on the matter well also be working with data protection authorities and others as we implement this ruling this group according to google includes eric schmidt googles executive chair david drummond googles chief legal counsel frank la rue  un special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression peggy valcke  director university of leuven law school jose luis piar the former head of spains data protection authority jimmy wales  cofounder of wikipedia luciano floridi  an information ethics philosopher at oxford internet institute what about bing  yahoo the eu ruling isnt just a google specific thing any search engine with a presence in the eu that can be defined by things such as having local sales offices must comply that includes both yahoo and bing yahoo says its developing its own solution telling us in light of the european court of justice decision our team is currently in the process of developing a solution for yahoo users in europe that we believe balances the important privacy and freedom of expression interests as for bing it doesnt appear to be taking any action to comply at all from its statement given the complexity of the ruling and the questions that remain about how it will implemented its really too early to speculate on its impact on google or anyone else for that matter we remain hopeful that the courts and data protection authorities will strike the right balance between protecting privacy rights and the freedom of expression ultimately bing will likely have to come up with a solution for two reasons itll be legally required to and because since yahoo uses bings search results yahoo will need bing to help it develop its own solution both companies were also asked if theyve had any requests received so far neither answered that question postscript this story was updated about 12 hours after it was first posted to include statements from yahoo and bing postscript 2 google has released some basic stats on how the first day has gone googles right to be forgotten form gets 12000 submissions on first day 
europes top court people have right to be forgotten on internet brussels may 13 people can ask google to delete sensitive information from its internet search results europes top court said on tuesday the case underlines the battle between advocates of free expression and supporters of privacy rights who say people should have the right to be forgotten meaning that they should be able to remove their digital traces from the internet the ruling by the luxembourg based european union court of justice ecj came after a spanish man complained to the spanish data protection agency that an auction notice of his repossessed home on googles search results infringed his privacy the case is one of 180 similar cases in spain whose complainants want google to delete their personal information from the web the company says forcing it to remove such data amounts to censorship if following a search made on the basis of a persons name the list of results displays a link to a web page which contains information on the person in question that data subject may approach the operator directly and where the operator does not grant his request bring the matter before the competent authorities in order to obtain under certain conditions the removal of that link from the list of results the judges said an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties they said reporting by foo yun chee 
the right to be forgotten or how to edit your history the right to be forgotten is a very successful political slogan like all successful political slogans it is like a rorschach test people can see in it what they want the debate would sound quite different if the slogan were actually something more descriptive for example the right to delete the european commission has now proposed to make the right to be forgotten into a law its a big step to turn a vague political slogan into a law the time for vague slogans must now give way to a more practical discussion of how the right to be forgotten could actually work what is the right to be forgotten there is a spectrum of views on one end of the spectrum the right to be forgotten is simply viewed as a re branding of long standing data protection principles in particular the rights to access and rectify ones own personal data the right to oppose processing of ones personal data in the absence of legitimate purposes the principle of data minimization on this end of the spectrum people think that the right to be forgotten is nothing new at most it is simply an attempt to apply long standing data protection principles to the new worlds of the internet and modern technologies im firmly in this school of thought on the other end of the spectrum the right to be forgotten is viewed more sweepingly as a new right to delete information about oneself even if published by a third party even if the publication was legitimate and the content was true this school of thought believes that people should have the right to force third parties to delete content about them photos blogs anything that violates their sense of privacy which in practice usually means their online reputations common examples of things people want to remove are compromising photos references to past criminal matters negative comments etc while i strongly believe that people should have the right to complain to third party websites about information that is published there about them i am deeply skeptical that the laws should obligate such third parties to delete information on request of data subjects this raises troubling questions of freedom of expression there is an even more extreme end of the right to be forgotten spectrum which holds that this deletion right can be exercized not just against the publisher of the content eg a newspaper website but even against hosting platforms and other intermediaries like search engines that merely host or link to this third party content this view is being litigated in spain as the spanish data protection authority is suing google to delete links to third party content like newspaper articles that the dpa has acknowledged are legal in other words the dpa is attempting to apply this reading of the right to be forgotten to delete links to content in a search engine despite the fact that the original content is legal and will remain on the web cases like this will require judicial review since they clearly posit a conflict of two fundamental rights privacy and the right to be forgotten against freedom of expression i expect this issue to be considered at the european court of justice as this debate unfolds the lack of clarity is raising false expectations as people read that there will soon be a legal right to be forgotten they are asking dpas and search engines to delete third party content about themselves or links to such content i regularly hear requests from people to remove all references to me mrs x from the internet no law can or should provide such a right and politicians and dpas should not mis lead them to expect it we need more public debate about what the right to be forgotten should mean we also need a debate about how it should be applied to hosting platforms and search engines i think a balanced and reasonable and implementable approach is possible based on a few principles 1 people should have the rights to access rectify delete or move the data they publish online 2 people should not have the automatic right to delete what other people publish about them since privacy rights cannot be deemed to trump freedom of expression recognizing that some mechanisms need to be streamlined to resolve these conflicts 3 web intermediaries host or find content but they dont create or review it and intermediaries shouldnt be used as tools to censor the web stay tuned and happy data protection day

the territorial reach of the eus right to be forgotten think locally but act globally brendan van alsenoy is a legal researcher at the interdisciplinary centre for law  ict icri ku leuven  iminds marieke koekkoek is a research fellow at the leuven centre for global governance studies ggs ku leuven in may of this year the court of justice of the european union cjeu decided that individuals can  under certain conditions  ask google  photo credit  to stop referring to certain information about them the cjeus recognition of this so called right to be forgotten has kicked up quite a storm now that the dust is beginning to settle its time to direct our attention to questions of practical implementation one set of questions is about territorial reach how far should the right to be forgotten extend geographically speaking should google upon finding that an individuals request is justified modify its search results globally or should it only modify search results shown within the eu according to press reports  googles current approach is to limit its modification of results to the european versions of the search engine search results of people using googlecom remain unaltered while people using googlees or googlebe may no longer be seeing the full picture however google still allows its eu users to switch to thecom version simply by clicking a button at the bottom of the page eu users can also freely navigate to other country specific versions of the search engine whose search results may not be filtered in the same way by not taking further measures to limit access to forgotten search results it seems as if the search engine is needlessly provoking the wrath of european data protection authorities so what should the search engine be doing realistically speaking only two approaches seem viable the first option would be to keep it local by filtering the search results for queries originating from eu territory  regardless of which country version of google is being used the second option would be to go global which would involve modification of search results worldwide to be clear either approach would only kick in once google has decided to grant a specific request and would only affect results following a name search  it is true that nothing in the cjeu ruling suggests that google would be justified in limiting itself to specific websites countries or regions but as even the chairwoman of the article 29 working party has acknowledged  the matter may not be so clear cut public international law offers a useful frame of reference to assess the extra territorial effects of eu data protection law see also this earlier entry by christopher kuner however the question before us today is not one of legislative or adjudicative jurisdiction per se this issue has already been dealt with by the cjeu in its ruling see paragraphs 42 60  and has been analyzed elsewhere what concerns us today is the extra territorial reach of implementation how far can or should the eu go when requiring google to implement the right to be forgotten in answering this question it is useful to consider legal precedents involving both public and private international law the argument in favor of keeping it local one of the most well known cases on internet jurisdiction is uejf and licra v yahoo and yahoo france here yahoo was sued for hosting an auction page displaying nazi paraphernalia this page was accessible from any place in the world including france where the display of nazi paraphernalia is outlawed the tribunal de grande instance tgi of paris ordered yahoo to take all necessary measures to prevent french residents from accessing the pages in question but it only confirmed this order after satisfying itself that it would be technically feasible for yahoo to determine with sufficient probability whether or not a page request originated from french territory there are several reasons why the approach of the tgi made sense a first reason is rooted in the principle of territoriality which acts as the primary basis for jurisdiction in public international law as noted by the district court of california  a basic function of a sovereign state is to determine by law what forms of speech and conduct are acceptable within its borders  if the tgi were to have ordered yahoo to stop displaying the pages globally it would have interfered with the sovereignty of other states a second argument in favor of territorial limitation can be derived simply by considering the alternative if states would be free to restrict the accessibility of information in other parts of the world eventually only the lowest common denominator would remain only content tolerated by the most restrictive regime would stay available online both these arguments suggest that that the geographical borders of a state should as a general rule delineate its ability to impose restrictions upon the accessibility of online content the argument in favor of going global the arguments in favor of territorial limitation seem quite compelling  especially when one thinks about them in the abstract but when one considers the specific facts of a particular case things start to look slightly different for example looking at the facts that preceded the cjeu ruling  one can find several elements that might justify a spanish order for global modification of search results 1 the announcement referenced by google was published by a spanish newspaper 2 the website indexed by google was hosted by a server located in spain 3 the announcement to which google was referring concerned a spanish citizen and 4 the search term used consisted of the name of a spanish citizen taken together these elements suggest that the content in question is more closely related to spain than to any other country from this perspective one can argue that it should be up to the spanish authorities to decide whether googles search results should be modified globally or not moreover if spain had decided to go after the source of the publication  a move well within its rights at least from the perspective of public international law  the information would have become globally inaccessible a spanish order for global modification of search results might therefore be less of a jurisdictional overreach than initially thought a recent example of a global injunction against google is provided by equustek solutions inc v jack in this case canadian company equustekclaimed that jack et al had misappropriated equusteks goodwill by performing a bait and switch jack et al advertised equustuk products on their websites but delivered their own products instead once a sale was made in the end the supreme court of british columbia considered it necessary to issue an injunction with global effect in order to adapt to the borderless nature of the internet the court also noted that googles removal of search results from googleca alone was inadequate to offer the plaintiffs effective relief needless to say this judgment also invited some mixed reviews while the competency of the bc court in equustek was essentially a matter of private international law examples of interest based reasoning can also be found in public international law doctrine see for example ryngaert at p 4 et seq the way forward in conclusion it seems that valid arguments can be made for both the local and global approach if one rigidly clings to the territoriality principle successful forget me requests should only affect local search results however as the right to be forgotten is based on an eu directive the case for modification of results throughout the eu is easily made others will feel that the nexus with eu territory is sufficiently strong to justify a global implementation order when deemed appropriate by the competent authority one might even argue that this is the only way to ensure an effective and complete protection of eu data subjects see also paragraph 58 of the cjeu ruling  both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages nobody really likes the idea of applying territorial zoning to the internet but this is already the world we live in at the same time we must stay mindful that geo filtering mechanisms are not iron clad anyone willing to invest some time and money will easily circumvent them eg by using a proxy server its quite possible that eu authorities will consider such additional costs to be sufficiently dissuasive if not it looks like the only satisfactory approach will be to go global in the end the final outcome will depend on how far eu regulators are willing and able to push this the further litigation of the yahoo case in the us suggests that any attempt to see the right to be forgotten enforced in the us would most likely fail eu enforcement capabilities therefore seem limited by and large to googles assets within the eu but of course one shouldnt lose sight of googles interest in the eu market as long as the gains outweigh the costs google is unlikely to ignore enforcement actions which would interfere with its ability to sell advertising space to eu businesses to be continued  
on the need for erasure the hedgehog review  vol 17 no 1 spring 2015 on the need for erasure wilfred m mcclay reprinted from the hedgehog review 171 spring 2015 this essay may not be resold reprinted or redistributed for compensation of any kind without prior written permission please contact the hedgehog review for further details t he first time i ever saw the words littera scripta manet  they were inscribed on an exquisite little poster hanging beside the desk of a typographer employed by one of the last letterpress printers in north america the meaning in english is the written word remains a declaration that had an immediate appeal for me attributed to the roman poet horace and embraced by the great english printer william caxton this ancient saying bespeaks a quiet pride in the weight and dignity of the written text and especially in the permanence fixity and distilled authority of fine printing the spoken word depends upon the flickering and inconstant flame of oral transmission for its survival not so the written word the page on which it appears is a tangible thing an embodied thing one that occupies an enduring place in the world a distinct niche in space and time a home on ones bookshelf as such the written word is more fully in the world even as it shows a greater capacity to transcend the world to raise our gaze above the immediate replacing the worlds ephemera with enduring objects of contemplation but all this needs to be re thought in the age of the internet and of the digitization of all knowledge and communications for if there is one thing we know or are coming to understand it is that the things posted on the internetthe digital word or image or song or videoalso remain whether we like it or not and irrespective of their importance this omnivorous placeless and decontextualized permanence of the internet contrasts sharply even jarringly with the ephemeral and whimsical and personal and intimate charactersome of it potentially embarrassing and even damagingof so many of the things we are posting on it the millions who expend so much of their time and energy on social media such as twitter facebook instagram tumblr and the like are largely unconcerned to put it mildly that todays words might be overheard by their contemporaries but neither are these social media devotees thinking much about the likelihood that todays words will be overheard twenty or more years from now by their prospective employers or their own children or by their political professional or personal rivals words that will then be shorn of any friendly or explanatory context behind this wonderfully empowering technology which seems to inspire so much fancy and froth and expressive creativity there is also a relentless and remorseless capture of experience which feeds an elephant that never forgets this is a price some are unwilling to pay one of the reasons we value the right of privacy is that we value the right to conceal or withhold and thereby to have some say over the terms of our engagement with the larger world every one of us has done and said things we wish could be forgotten and in the fullness of time they generally are or so it used to be that erasure is far harder to be assured of in a world in which the elephant that never forgets also never sleeps and in which the digitally stored word remains and remains and remains which is why the top court of the european union has ruled that its existing data protection law guarantees the right to be forgotten enabling citizens to compel data controllers such as google to delete certain private information after a certain time while this right remains contested and is so far generally confined to the deletion of public access to unwanted and outdated online data about oneself it could eventually be construed to extend far beyond that to almost any imaginable data that could affect ones reputation and self presentation the impulse behind such rights talk is understandable no one can blame the victim of a false arrest or wayward prosecution for wanting the record expunged and the decontextualized and disaggregated character of information on the internet lends itself to all kinds of abuses providing factoid fodder for the kind of gotcha journalism and political opposition researchnot to mention sheer character assassinationwe already have in such abundance such practices not only coarsen our public discourse and frighten worthy people away from the ordeal of public service but also render rational discussion of public issues almost impossible and on a personal level do we want to be judged and forever found wanting because of the time we posted something injudicious or said something uncharitable or did something impulsive or wrongheaded or exuberantly imprudent i fear especially in this regard for the young who feed the elephant with unrestrained candor and seem heedless of the possibility that they may be thereby compiling the elements of a future brief against themselves it seems lamentable that one should have to counsel caution in these matters whatever happened to the prerogatives of youth during the presidential campaign of 2000 george w bush deflected persistent charges relating to his reputation for youthful misbehavior with the following statement when i was young and foolish i wasyoung and foolish an evasive answer possibly but i think in retrospect a good one in that it reflects the ecology of mind we need to keep in view young people need to be able to be young to live out the exuberance and callowness of youth to make their own missteps and to be able to count on some measure of erasure and forgiveness of all that as they move forward into adulthood but the unsleeping digital beast they love so much may make that more difficult in the years to come this should not be read as a call for the wanton erasure of memory on the contrary memory is the very core of our personal identity and it is most powerful when it is purposeful and selective above all it requires that we possess stories and narrativescontextsthat link facts in ways that are both meaningful and true rather than treat them as a mass of disaggregated data to be exploited as we or others might wish what makes for intelligent and discerning memory is not the mere capacity for massive retention but a certain balance and order in the mental economy of remembering and forgetting in other words memory takes an active role in thinning out the mental trees so that the forests can be discerned we need to retain less if we are to remember more in so doing we may rediscover the enduring virtues of ink on paper of scripta that remain in one place as the vehicle for a new kind of samizdat one that eschews the digital grid altogether  wilfred m mcclay 
recommendations on the right to be forgotten by la quadrature du net and reporters without borders introduction the european union court of justice ruling of 13 may 2014 on a case brought by google spain highlighted the problems for the protection of freedom of expression and the right to information posed by the right to de indexation from search engine results and more broadly the right to be forgotten privacy and freedom of expression are fundamental rights of equal value articles 8 and 10 of the european convention on human rights and articles 8 and 11 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union whenever one conflicts with the other a balance must be reached under a judges authority because as a matter of principle one cannot be given more importance than the other the eucj ruling requires search engine operators such as google to deal with requests made by members of the public for the removal of search engine results attached to their names responsibility for a decision involving individual freedoms that should be handled by a court is thereby delegated in practice to a private sector company this delegation of responsibility is all the more dangerous because the ruling is based on vague and general principles that provide no guarantee for freedom of expression in response to the eucj ruling google established an advisory committee that is currently working on the formulation of more precise rules for search engine operators on how to respond to requests to be removed from results the questions that google is asking on how to strike a fair balance between the right to de indexation from results and the publics freedom of expression and information are perfectly legitimate but the fact that a private sector company is posing these questions accentuates the growing trend to privatize the implementation of internet regulation and is therefore unacceptable national data protection bodies such as the the cnil  the french data protection authority are meanwhile also working on the formulation of precise rules in response to the eucjs ruling but in so doing they too are exceeding their powers in the absence of sufficiently clear legislation such government agencies have neither legitimacy nor competence for the formulation and application of rules designed to ensure a balance between the protection of privacy and freedom of expression the response must therefore come from national and european legislators it is their duty to establish a clear legal framework that takes full account of freedom of expression and is implemented by the courts with this in mind reporters without borders and la quadrature du net jointly drafted this paper which identifies points of concerns and makes recommendations designed to reconcile the right to privacy with freedom of expression in a reasonable manner under the aegis of the courts and not the private sector or government agencies we now present them as a contribution to the ongoing debate on the right to be forgotten misapplying the right to privacy to editorial content in france the provisions on the protection of persondal data from the directive of 24 october 1995 have been applied to editorial content and other informations of public interest based on the fact that they broadly define data of a personal nature as any information concerning an identified or identifiable physical person this is so even though both article 9 of this directive and article 67 of the frances law on information technology and freedoms provide an exception for journalistic purposes as a result under the cnils supervision data protection laws are already widely used to curtail freedom of expression before the eucj ruling on the right to be removed from search engine results this was made clear in a recent statement by cnil president isabelle falque pierrotin complaints involving the right to be forgotten are almost all honoured and the content is withdrawn they concern comments in blogs an unwanted photo or a court decision that someone wants suppressed 1 using data protection laws to obtain the removal of published content and restrict freedom of expression through the right to opposition and rectification under the ruling of administrative authority constitutes an extremely dangerous circumvention of the traditional principle of the judicial protection of freedom of speech established in france with the law of 29 july 1881 on press freedom this is why the vice president of a paris high court said in a ruling on 12 october 2009 the constitutionally and conventionally guaranteed principle of freedom of expression forbids  any violation of the rules established by the law of 6 january 1978 which is not one of the laws that was specially created to restrict this freedom in according with the second section of article 10 of the european convention on human rights similarly a paris appeal court ruling of 26 february 2014 said that suppressing online links to an article may violate media freedom the court is of the view that forcing a media outlet to modify its online archive of articles  either by suppressing information itself withdrawing surnames and first names of persons concerned by judicial decisions thereby depriving the article of any interest or by restricting access by modifying the usual online links exceeds the restrictions that may be placed on media freedom in europe at the european level a ruling by the european court of human rights on 16 june 2013 rejected a request by two polish lawyers for the suppression of a newspaper article that had been deemed libellous by a polish court but continued to be accessible on the newspapers website seeking a balance between the right to defend ones reputation and the right to information the european court ruled that withdrawal of the article would amount to censorship and to rewriting history these decisions shed light on the appropriate scope that should be given to the exception for journalism provisions on the protection of personal data should not affect freedom of expression they should remain inapplicable to all editorial content and all information of public interest given a certain desire on the part of european union member states to follow up on the eucj ruling by considerably reinforcing the right to be forgotten and the right to deletion it is important to restrict these rights in order to protect freedom of expression the rules must be amended to reinforce the exception for journalism by extending it to all editorial content and other information of public interest after this legislative clarification has been enacted the right to privacy and the freedom of expression can be properly balanced under national and international law and the relevant jurisprudence for example in france article 9 of the civil code or articles 226 1 and 226 2 of the penal code while respecting the existing guarantees of freedom of expression such as those in the 1881 media law recommendations base arbitration between the right to privacy and freedom of expression on common law provisions or when appropriate on respect for the guarantees applicable to media rights and not on special data protection laws as part of the negotiations under way on european regulation on personal data extend the exception for journalism to all editorial content and information of public interest and restrict application of the right to be forgotten under article 17 to data put online by the data subject himself pending the adoption of the european regulation establish a moratorium on measures based on this special right that restrict freedom of expression and the right to information or otherwise adopt interim measures that fully respect freedom of expression at the european level consider complementing the rules on protection of privacy with legislation that protects freedom of expression above all in order to reconcile these two fundamental rights the role of search engines in access to information by interpreting the concept of controller of the personal data broadly the eucj has extended it to search engine operators and has put private sector companies in charge of handling requests for the deletion of links in search engine results the eucjs decision seems to stem from a conservative and erroneous vision of the internet and what search engines do at no point did the court mention the role of search engines in gathering information and their contribution to freedom of expression instead it limited itself to stressing the dangers resulting from the important role played by the internet and search engines in modern society which render the information contained in such a list of results ubiquitous while the internet and search engines may indeed make it harder to protect privacy they also play a very positive role from the viewpoint of freedom of expression a recommendation on the protection of human rights in connection with search engines adopted by the committee of ministers of the council of europe on 4 april 2012 2 said search engines enable a worldwide public to seek receive and impart information and ideas and other content in particular to acquire knowledge engage in debate and participate in democratic processes frances council of state pointed out in a recent report that removing links from search results affects the freedom of information of the websites publisher by making the published information less accessible and thereby returning it to the pre internet situation 3 because of the role of search engines in facilitating access to editorial content and information of public interest there are significant dangers involved in treating search engine operators as personal data controllers it removes measures directly affecting online freedom of expression and information from the judicial domain and prevents sufficient account being taken of the different interests and rights at play moreover as eucj advocate general niilo jskinen said in a preliminary report on the google spain case it would be absurd to hold search engines responsible for the personal data on the web pages to which their search results refer he said if internet search engine service providers were considered as controllers of the personal data on third party source web pages and if on any of these pages there would be special categories of data referred to in article 8 of the directive eg personal data revealing political opinions or religious beliefs or data concerning the health or sex life of individuals the activity of the internet search engine service provider would automatically become illegal when the stringent conditions laid down in that article for the processing of such data were not met for this reason among others search engine operators should not be regarded as the personal data controllers the plaintiff must go to the source asking the personal data controller to withdraw or correct the information that was posted online and was then indexed by the search engine this also applies to links to content that is neither editorial in nature nor of public interest data protection authorities should nonetheless be empowered to order search engine operators to update their results after getting a personal data controller to remove or correct content individuals should be able to ask their national agency to order search engine operators to correct or suppress the relevant information in their web page excerpts or in their caches in the same manner as courts have ordered search engines to remove links to illegal amend european personal data regulations to reflect the fact that search engines and other internet facilitators of access to information are essential for exercising the right to information and provide links to editorial content and information of public interest and should therefore be covered by a broad interpretation of the exception for journalism and should not be regarded as personal data controllers in the case of links to personal data with no editorial content and no information of public interest give data protection agencies the power to order search engine operators to update the information displayed in their results while not treating them as personal data controllers defence rights and appropriate procedures in a democracy it is not the role of private sector companies or even frances cnil or its equivalent in other european countries to determine the right balance between the protection of privacy and freedom of expression in its decision on the law on the confidence in the digital economy in 2004 frances constitutional council said with reference to the withdrawal of online content by private sector companies determining whether a message is illegal can be delicate even for a lawyer this would also apply to search engine operators trying to determine whether search engine result deletions would restrict freedom of expression and the right to information the publishers of online content have the right to a fair hearing if requests are made for the removal of links to their content and this right cannot be respected if a private sector company is taking the decisions similarly the authorities in charge of protecting privacy do not have the required competence or legitimacy for examining such requests and determining the limits that should be set on freedom of expression as frances constitutional council said in its ruling of 10 june 2009 on the hadopi law legislators cannot give an administrative agency even an independent one the power to restrict the right to express oneself freely as this is about balancing fundamental rights it can only be a judge the guarantor of individual freedoms who can perform the task of reaching a decision in a dispute thereby also fully guaranteeing the right to a fair hearing if some cases the judges intervention could follow mediation process aimed a reaching an out of court settlement of a dispute involving the right to be forgotten in such mediation both parties the plaintiff who claims that his or her privacy has been violated and the publisher of the disputed content should be able to defend their viewpoint and obtain legal advice finally in the event that it is determined that freedom of expression was indeed abused in order to violate privacy various types of measure should be envisaged the eucj ruling focuses on deleting links from search engine results but updating the disputed content deleting only some of the information it contains anonymization or use of pseudonyms may be more appropriate and proportionate according to each case recommandations in accordance with the principle of judicial protection for freedom of expression ensure that only a judge has the power to reconcile freedom of expression and respect for privacy consider creating a multistakeholder mediation body that allows the parties to the dispute to reach an out of court settlement with recourse to a judge clearly still being possible in the event of failure to reach an agreement bear in mind that deleting links from search engine results is just one of several possible measures for reconciling freedom of expression with the right to privacy and that updating the disputed content deleting some of its information anonymization or use of pseudonyms may prove more appropriate read in pdf comment the recommendations 
thanks to right to be forgotten google now censors the press in the eu the eus right to be forgotten removals have been happening for about a week on google and now news publications are discovering the fallout for some searches you cant find their news stories relating to certain people in particular both the bbc and the guardian have shared examples of content thats now been forgotten in google the stories remain on the sites of both publications you just cant locate them for certain searches related to the names of individuals they are about postscript 550pm et add the daily mail to the list which has posted about removal notices it has received whats been forgotten among the forgotten are these pieces three stories from october and november 2010 about scottish football referee dougie mcdonald who self admittedly lied about reversing a penalty the daily mail also received a similar request for a story it has guardian  daily mail a story from 2002 about paul baxendale walker being accused of fraud he was later found not guilty of that charge guardian an archive page with a weeks worth of news where its hard to tell which person might have been involved guardian an article about how workers in france were decorating their office windows with post it notes guardian a 2007 commentary about stan oneal the then chair of merrill lynch bbc a story about tesco workers attacking their employer on social media daily mail a story about a couple having sex on a train daily mail a story about a muslim man who accused cathay pacific of discrimination daily mail the media outlets know that these stories have been dropped from google because both have received the new notices that googles sending out to inform publishers when removals happen  such as this example we illustrated today on our search engine land site the bbc cited its example james ball the author of the guardian article about its removals confirmed to me via email having received notices for all the guardian removals he also said that so far no further notices have come in the mess that is the right to be forgotten this latest chapter with removals is showing how messy and confusing this whole process is one that wasnt developed by any organized attempt to figure out pros cons and implementation issues but instead by flat decree by the eu court of justice consider these major points the freedom of the press issues are becoming apparent its difficult to know what was forgotten and why yet its becoming easier to remember what was supposedly forgotten de facto censorship of the press its very important to understand that the eus action is not causing content to be removed from publishers themselves which would no doubt have raised a huge outcry among major news outlets they usually dont remove content theyve published without an exceptionally good reason or a court order rather the articles are being removed from google for certain searches the court went this route understanding that if you pull something out of google and search engines generally that can effectively cause the material to be hidden more easily than someone trying to track down many different publishers that might carry the same thing thats especially an issue when it comes to scraper sites where someone might simply copy the content off another site without permission and republish it copyright owners know what a whack a mole situation this is where getting one removed only makes room for another to spring up but the eu action is arguably a de facto censorship of the press news stories are being made to disappear without any court review instead google seems to be following the letter of the new eu mandate and rubber stamping any reasonable request that comes along hard to know who wants something forgotten the removals are also leading to confusion about who might have tried to get something pulled consider the case of stan oneal the former head of merrill lynch in that bbc article that has been removed if you search for his name on google uk you get one of the new notices that google shows to searchers to indicate a right to be forgotten removal may have happened so is oneal working to scrub his record out of google salon thinks so  but we dont actually know see those notices are also showing up for names even if there was no removal as our story on search engine land from yesterday explains in addition if i search on googlecom  where removals do not happen  i dont find the story in question for all we know it could involve one of the people who left a comment consider this the lower arrow points to a notice for a search on peter dragomer suggesting that something has been removed from google for his name hes also the first person who commented on the oneal story maybe dragomer found that this story was coming up tops for his name in google didnt like it and decided to remove it chances are thats not the case as you can see from the upper arrow the article in question is showing up for his name the removal notice is likely appearing because of googles intended policy to make it a blanket notice for all name searches that means using the presence of such a notice to effectively convict someone of filing a removal notice is wrong you cant trust that notice all we know for certain is that google told the bbc that this page would be censored in google we dont know for what name and guesswork remains that  just guesswork which could be wrong yes easier to know who wants something forgotten conversely as these notices continue to flow out its likely to become easier to know if someone did ask for a removal  which is contrary to the eu courts goal and a result of it poorly thinking out how this new mandate would actually happen in balls article at the guardian he suggested perhaps setting up a twitter account to tweet all the links that have been removed as they come in that or something else would happen and coupled with searches on googlecom compared to eu versions of google it might be possible to compile a growing list of the articles some people have demanded be forgotten in turn ironically that might make these articles even more remembered if former referee dougie mcdonald really did put in requests to remove three guardian articles about his penalty incident hes got a lot more work to do its not hard to find other publications that covered it with the first and third arrows being examples under googles current system hed had to request removal of each and every article individually the second arrow also indicates another problem for anyone especially noteworthy making a removal request from a major publication probably will get that publication to write an article about your request which youll only get removed by filing a new request which probably will generate yet another article and so on the removal that didnt happen the last arrow is especially important one of the guardian articles that was supposedly removed from google for a search on dougie mcdonald is showing up at the bottom of the results for this search that i conducted on google uk also further up but not marked with an arrow is the story supposedly removed from the daily mail still showing up maybe the story was removed because someone else was mentioned maybe it only shows for other variations of the name maybe if i were actually in the uk it might be dropped its hard to tell though indications are that it even shows up there so why would ball think it was dropped in his article he searched for dougie mcdonald guardian into both googlecom and google uk because he didnt see the three articles the guardian got notices about showing him he assumed that the articles were dropped for mcdonalds name but a search for dougie mcdonald guardian isnt a pure name search which is all the eu order applies to if you really want to know if something was dropped you have to search for just the name alone and even then it can be confusing postscript july 8 google has confirmed to marketing land that it is actually filtering for names as well as those names plus other words so if an emily white objected to a story showing for her name and google granted a removal the story would no longer appear for her name or for her name with other words such as emily white bankrupt googles mess the eus mess  moving forward this isnt a mess that google created nor wanted but so far id say the company has been handling the process in a fairly inept fashion it declared it would do notices of removals at the bottom of search results then it ended up in a place where its showing notices even if removals dont happen so that its attempt at transparency has turned into an exercise in confusion it declared it would give site owners notice when removals are happening but those removals dont explain what searches the removals are happening for or why so publishers cant raise any objections most importantly it has foolishly decided to be the first arbiter of what gets censored under this new ill defined and easily abused right far better as i wrote after the new right was mandated to kick all these requests over to the various eu privacy bodies and let them make such decisions one strategy would be for google or any search engine to decide not to decide any request it receives it could respond that unless the request relates to some very specific situations it will be rejected because google doesnt believe it can fairly judge between the right of privacy and the right of free speech instead google could recommend that someone go to a particular countrys privacy agency for a ruling and let that agency make the call instead google decided to go ahead with making the initial decision that leads directly to the guardians article where the headline and subhead that puts the blame on google as the bold parts below emphasize eus right to be forgotten guardian articles have been hidden by google publishers must fight back against this indirect challenge to press freedom which allows articles to be disappeared editorial decisions belong with them not google make no mistake google doesnt want to be doing this type of censorship it fought against it and ultimately this is a problem for the eu governments to figure out but by making decisions about what should be censored rather than initially rejecting all requests for regulatory review  as it could have done  google has helped make the situation get even messier i am sympathetic to the company not wanting to fight harder on this however the privacy regulators seem to uniformly hate it its also under severe anti trust attention in the eu it feels like google decided it was easier to cave on the issue and just give in ultimately its an eu problem however maybe now that press publications are realizing that they face de facto censorship theyll put more pressure on how removals are handled in the end many people can sympathize with someone wanting results about their one time mistake or long ago embarrassing action removed unfortunately the eus rules seem to give the same right to be forgotten to these people as it does to pedophiles serious criminals fraudsters politicians and others it feels like there ought be be a better way postscript some answers from google i got a few answers from google on related questions to this story it wouldnt comment on whether dougie mcdonald or stan oneal put in requests for removals of articles about themselves i didnt expect google would comment but i wanted to at least ask it also wouldnt comment on whether the fact that articles about dougie mcdonald listed for removal but still showing up for his name as explained above means that perhaps the requests were related to having them removed for someone elses name my own takeaway here remains as explained above  people who are assuming mcdonald made these requests might be drawing the wrong conclusion google also wouldnt comment on how many news articles have been impacted so far nor give any update on how many requests it is currently processing when the form first opened google was receiving about 10000 requests per day ive tried several times for an update on these figures to understand if the pace is growing or dropping no luck my assumption is that the pace is dropping if it was growing id have expected google to publicize that as proof of what a burden the new right is turning into google did confirm that those outside the eu who go to an eu specific version of google will see removals as if they were in the eu ie its been clear that google might remove content from google uk for those in the uk it was also clear that those in the uk who go to googlecom wouldnt have the content removed but it wasnt clear if those outside the uk going to google uk would get censored results the answer yes google also confirmed that removals are only done for exact names submitted so if someone like larry page wanted results removed for his name and submitted for larry page that would happen but they wouldnt be removed for lawrence page unless a separate request was submitted finally can people outside the eu have their content removed googles removal form doesnt make this clear nor require any type of proof of citizenship or residency however google told me the form can be filed by eu citizens or residents so for others  they seem to be out of luck postscript 2 google has now restored some of the links our follow up story has more the eus right to be forgotten is a mess  how googles making it worse related articles about the author 
european court rules against google in favour of right to be forgotten the eus court of justice has ruled against google in a case in which a spanish citizen backed by his national data protection authority wanted the company to remove search links to an old local newspaper story related to his bankruptcy jef ausloos of of the interdisciplinary centre for law and ict icri of the university of leuven explains some key issues in the case arguing that implications should not be too extreme but warns of the courts prioritising of data subjects over internet users the court of justice of the european union cjeu finally released its long awaited judgment in the google spain c 13112 case in short the court decided that individuals do have a right to request search engines to remove links to webpages when the individuals name is used as a search query this ruling cannot be overturned and is now referred back to the national court theoretically it is still possible for google to take this case to the european court of human rights based on article 10 echr  once the national court makes a final decision although the case is often referred to as the right to be forgotten case it does not hinge upon the similarly named provision in the proposed data protection regulation instead the main legal basis in this decision was the data protection directive 9546 hereafter the directive including the rights to object art14 and to erasure 12b the case is particularly interesting because it lies at the intersection of data protection law freedom of expression and intermediary liability rules a detailed discussion on this interaction is available here  the cjeu was asked to answer three main questions relating to 1 the territorial scope of the directive 2 the material and personal scope of the directive and 3 whether or not data subjects have a right to objecterasure when it comes to search engines directly scope of application with regard to the first two questions the court was rather straight forward to the extent that  the operator of a search engine sets up in a member state a branch or subsidiary which is intended to promote and sell advertising space offered by that engine and which orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that member state  the processing falls within the territorial scope of application of the directive art41a 60 given the fact that search engines collect retrieve record organize store and make available they do process personal data and thus fall within the material scope of application of the directive art2b 28 29 the court also specified that search engines activities can be distinguished from and are additional to those carried out by the original publishers hence they should be considered controllers art2d 41 right to be forgotten will it be flooded with requests for erasure photo by robert scoble cc by 20 the third category of questions that was presented to the cjeu related to the so called right to be forgotten and constitutes the most controversial aspect in this case some of the key issues are limited scope of the judgement first of all it is important not to overemphasise the impact of this judgment on the right to freedom of expression art 11 charter  art10 echr  in this particular case the request related specifically to the link between using an individuals name as a search query and the search result referring to a particular webpage in other words even if the request is granted the same webpage can still be reached through other  maybe more relevant  search terms no obligation to delete but an obligation to balance one should not conclude that any individual can now request search engines to delete links to webpages when their name is used as a search term instead such requests will still have to comply with the requirements under article 12b right to erasure andor article 14 right to object put briefly these provisions require a balance to be made between opposing rights and interests 74 76 hence the plaintiff will have to substantiate hisher request and upon receiving such a request the search engine will have to make the necessary balance if the search engine does not grant the request the cjeu specified that the data subject can bring the matter before the supervisory or judicial authority so that it carries out the necessary checks 77 in other words search engines are not obliged to comply with takedown requests unless a supervisory or judicial authority issues them independent responsibility of search engines this observation ties back to the personal scope of the directive it was emphasised throughout the judgement that googles activities can clearly be distinguished from those of the original publishers the potential harm or negative consequences vis  vis the data subject will in many cases not result from an obscure publication in a local online newspaper but rather from the widespread and often decontextualised availability of the information through search engines a logical consequence is that even though the original content is published lawfully data subjects will still be able to request the removal from search engines directly it is important to distinguish this from potential requests directed to the original publisher eg to remove or blur out hisher personal data  over  burdening search engines upon first reading one could claim the judgment puts to big a burden on search engines after all paragraph 38 specifically states that the operator of a search must comply with all the requirements in the directive it goes without saying that subjecting search engines to the full application of the data protection directive gives rise to considerable concerns on the other hand the judgment does specify that search engines only need to comply with the directive within the framework of their responsibilities powers and capabilities 38 83 it is still too early however to predict how this will play out in practice presumption that data subjects rights trump all others one of the most important concerns i have at this stage concerns the courts presumption that  data subjects rights  override as a general rule the interest of internet users  as well as the economic interests of the search engine operator itself 81 in other words it seems that the court suggests an im balance of interests should be presumed favouring privacy interests over all others however the court does seem to nuance this by stating the balance might depend on the nature of the information its sensitivity the interest of the public the role of the relevant individual in public life etc needless to say that this wording is not conducive to legal certainty implications the ruling by the court of justice in google spain undoubtedly raised many eyebrows surprisingly it almost entirely goes against the opinion of the advocate general issued in june 2013 nevertheless it is still too early to draw general conclusions from the judgement even though at first glance it seems to considerably threaten freedom of expressioninformation interests much of the wording seems to be very nuanced and limited in scope when looked at more closely additionally the decision is entirely based on the existing legal framework directive 9546 it is hard to predict how the judgment will interact with the future data protection regulation which is already being drafted this article gives the views of the author and does not represent the position of the lse media policy project blog nor of the london school of economics 
index blasts eu court ruling on right to be forgotten   index on censorship index blasts eu court ruling on right to be forgotten by index on censorship  13 may 2014 todays decision from the court of justice of the european union violates the fundamental principles of freedom of expression the courts ruling means that under certain circumstances information can be removed from search engine results even if it is true and factual and without the original source material being altered it allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight this is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books although the ruling is intended for private individuals it opens the door to anyone who wants to whitewash their personal history by placing the onus on search engines to prevent dissemination of information the court has said that an individuals desires outweigh societys interest in the complete facts around incidents the ruling goes against the finding last year of the eu advocate general who said there was no right to be forgotten the courts decision is a retrograde move that misunderstands the role and responsibility of search engines and the wider internet it should send chills down the spine of everyone in the european union who believes in the crucial importance of free expression and freedom of information interview requests can be directed to  44 0207 260 2660 court of justice of the european union right to be forgotten 
google reveals which countries have used the right to be forgotten most frequently googles finding that a lot of people have things theyd rather others forget about in just about the first month and half that it was accepting requests for links to be removed under europes controversial new right to be forgotten law google says that it received over 91000 submissions asking that over 328000 links be removed google doesnt say exactly how many of those requests its fulfilled  and it sounds as though it hasnt even gotten to take a look at all of them yet either  but it does say that of those that its looked at just over half of the links have been accepted and removed france germany and the uk have the most requests the transparency comes in a letter google sent today to a group of european data protection agencies that requested information on how it was responding to these removal requests googles answers arent particularly enlightening largely detailing how its request form works google doesnt for instance explain precisely how it determines what is an irrelevant link  which wouldnt legally have to be removed  as opposed to a relevant link which would have to be removed google doesnt criticize the practice in the letter either despite making its opposition to the right to be forgotten law evident in the past it does however note that it has had some trouble in determining links relevance because its largely relying on information submitted by the person asking for a removal google explains that requesters might fail to include new information that could make what would otherwise look like an outdated link appear relevant again an example would be a request to remove an old article about a person being convicted of a number of crimes in their teenage years which omits that the old article has its relevance renewed due to a recent article about that person being convicted for similar crimes as an adult google writes otherwise the remaining trouble appears to rest with removal requests filed by people who simply dont understand how the form works some dont provide enough information others have asked that incorrect links be removed  google cites facebookcom as an example googles figures only represent right to be forgotten requests up to july 18th the figures also reveal that around half of the requests are coming through just three countries france germany and the uk the full breakdown from googles letter is below around 17500 requests have been made under french law as chosen by the requester in the webform involving around 58000 urls around 16500 requests have been made under german law involving around 57000 urls around 12000 requests have been made under uk law involving around 44000 urls around 8000 requests have been made under spanish law involving around 27000 urls around 7500 requests have been made under italian law involving around 28000 urls around 55000 requests have been made under dutch law involving around 21000 urls

google reverses decision to delete british newspaper links fri jul 4 2014 252am edt reuters   google inc on thursday reversed its decision to remove several links to stories in britains guardian newspaper underscoring the difficulty the search engine is having implementing europes right to be forgotten ruling the guardian protested the removal of its stories describing how a soccer referee lied about reversing a penalty decision it was unclear who asked google to remove the stories separately google has not restored links to a bbc article that described how former merrill lynch chief executive officer e stanley oneal was ousted after the investment bank racked up billions of dollars in losses the incidents underscore the uncertainty around how google intends to adhere to a may european court ruling that gave its citizens the right to be forgotten to request the scrubbing of links to articles that pop up under a name search privacy advocates say the backlash around press censorship highlight the potential dangers of the ruling and its unwieldiness in practice that in turn may benefit google by stirring debate about the soundness of the ruling which the internet search leader criticized the ruling from the outset google which has received more than 70000 requests began acting upon them in past days and it notified the bbc and the guardian which in turn publicized the moves the incidents suggest that requesting removal of a link may actually bring the issue back into the public spotlight rather than obscure it that possibility may give people pause before submitting a right to be forgotten request at least as it looks now there are definitely some unworkable components said electronic frontier foundation activist parker higgins weve seen a number of situations in the past few days where somebody in an effort to get a certain thing forgotten has brought more attention to it than ever was there before it does make you think that maybe if youre actually trying to make an episode of your history be forgotten this channel maybe isnt the best way googles objective is to protect the reliability and effectiveness of its search franchise it remains uncertain how it adjudicates requests or how they intend to carry them out going forward their current approach appears to be an overly broad interpretation a spokeswoman for the guardian said if the purpose of the judgment is not to enable censorship of publishers by the back door then wed encourage google to be transparent about the criteria it is using to make these decisions and how publishers can challenge them google which controls more than 90 percent of european online searches said it was a learning process this is a new and evolving process for us well continue to listen to feedback and will also work with data protection authorities and others as we comply with the ruling the company said in a statement notifying media outlets about scrubbed links has the effect of enhancing transparency privacy advocates say it might also prompt european courts to re examine aspects of the ruling including how it affects media outlets coverage its terra incognito for everyone said jonathan zittrain co founder of the berkman center for internet and society if sites that receive the notices choose to publicize them in ways that end up boomeranging against the people requesting that might cause the courts to examine what those sites are doing reporting by alexei oreskovic in san francisco and aurindom mukherjee in bangalore editing by kirti pandey and lisa shumaker  
google sticks to eu only application of right to be forgotten by julia fioretti brussels mon jan 19 2015 353pm est brussels reuters   google is only removing search results from european websites when individuals invoke their right to be forgotten contrary to regulators guidelines but will review that approach soon the companys chief legal officer said on monday the issue of how far the so called right to be forgotten should extend has concentrated the minds of europes privacy regulators since the continents top court ruled in may that individuals could have inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant information removed from search results google has consistently argued that it believes the ruling should only apply to its european websites such as googlede in germany or googlefr in france but the group of privacy watchdogs from eu countries the article 29 working party concluded in november that they want search engines to scrub results globally because of the ease of switching from a european domain to googlecom david drummond googles chief legal officer said the internet giants approach had not changed since november and it would review it when a group of experts publishes a report on last years court judgment towards the end of this month weve had a basic approach weve followed it on this question weve made removals europe wide but not beyond he said at an event in brussels on monday between september and november an advisory council including a former german justice minister and wikipedia founder jimmy wales held public meetings across europe to debate the balance between privacy and the free flow of information it is expected to publish a report with its conclusions at the end of january to help inform google on its application of the ruling well take that the report along with the article 29 input and other input and arrive at an approach drummond said its our strong view that there needs to be some way of limiting the concept because it is a european concept since the ruling in may google has received more than 200000 requests from across europe affecting over 700000 urls according to its online transparency report the eus privacy chiefs adopted a set of non binding guidelines in november to ensure the ruling is applied consistently across the blocs 28 member states citizens whose removal requests have been refused by a search engine can appeal to their national data protection regulator who can then take action against the company on friday the article 29 working party wrote to microsoft yahoo and french search engine qwant to remind them of the regulators view that results should be scrubbed across all relevant domains editing by david clarke  
the candidates on the arts trump on china media ratings and his inauguration earlier this month i sent a list of 13 questions about arts culture and freedom of speech to representatives for ted cruz john kasich donald trump bernie sanders and hillary clinton for too long these issues have been marginalized in national politics and my goal was to get as many candidates as possible on the record on the subject as well as to remind readers that culture plays a role in everything from our relationships with other countries to our economy on thursday trump became the first candidate to respond to my questions ive published his written responses in full below with notes where he didnt provide answers i hope other presidential hopefuls will follow and well post their responses as they do according to the bureau of economic analysis in 2013 arts and cultural businesses were a 7042 billion part of the american economy  and produced a 241 billion trade surplus what policies do you think would best promote economic growth in this sector and protect and expand this trade surplus especially in light of continuing questions about access to the chinese entertainment market as i have made clear on countless occasions the free market will inform us on what enterprises will flourish and which ones will fail in the context of my campaign i have also said on countless occasions that we should make sure that our free trade is also fair if chinese entertainment markets are closed because of unfair practices then we have an obligation to make sure that our companies and enterprises are not being taken advantage of should the united states have a foreign policy doctrine that determines how the administration responds when artists writers and journalists are detained executed or kidnapped by foreign governments  if so what should that doctrine consist of we do have a long history of taking care of american citizens when they are unjustly detained outside the united states however not all administrations have been as aggressive as they should have been a compelling national interest is to protect american citizens wherever they might be in my administration this approach will be followed with the utmost earnestness there are many different tools a president can use to make foreign policy what role would informational efforts and public diplomacy play in yours what would your administrations strategy be for programs like radio free europe radio liberty and the voice of america what do you think is the role of the state departments under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs what about the role of goodwill ambassadors who do you think best represents americas brand no answer how should the united states respond to internet censorship by foreign governments discussions of education policy have often focused on science technology engineering and math or stem as a set of core competencies though in recent years advocates including the congressional steam caucus have argued that art and design should be added to this list what guidance would your education department give states as they begin allocating funding for arts education which is considered part of a well rounded education under the every student succeeds act the states are best able to determine how education dollars are spent the federal government needs to get out of the education business and let the states local districts and parents determine what is taught in our schools does the federal government have a role to play in funding the creation and performance of art or in making art accessible to all americans federal funding for the national endowment for the arts currently stands at 148 million do you think that funding level is appropriate what would you request in your first budget as president the congress as representatives of the people make the determination as to what the spending priorities ought to be i had the great fortune to receive a comprehensive liberal arts education from an ivy league institution what is most important is that we examine how one size fits all approaches imposed by the federal government have corrupted the availability and efficacy of liberal arts education critical thinking skills the ability to read write and do basic math are still the keys to economic success a holistic education that includes literature and the arts is just as critical to creating good citizens what do you believe is the proper role for the federal communications commission in a changing communications environment should it regulate online content what is your position on the commissions net neutrality regulations if one believes in the free market system then it is hard to imagine how the fcc is helping things with rules associated with net neutrality in 2014 the european union established a right to be forgotten for its citizens should the united states adopt a similar practice how would such a right interact with the first amendment again this is something the peoples representatives should discuss and debate the first amendment protects free speech the establishment and practice of religion the free press the right to assemble and associate and the right to bring grievances seems that pretty much encapsulates how would approach seeking the right to be forgotten in 2019 copyrighted works will begin entering the public domain in the united states under the terms of the sonny bono copyright term extension act do you believe that the authors lifetime plus 70 years is the proper length for copyrights to last how would you balance the rights of creators and their families with the needs of archives libraries and other artists who rely on material in the public domain to create new work your questions seem to imply that the president can make law even though some presidents have acted that way i will not the congress will make this determination as is their constitutional obligation do the voluntary content ratings systems adopted by the movie music and video game industries give parents enough information to make decisions about what is appropriate for their children if not is some sort of government system warranted i think you answered your own question parents should make the determination about what their children should watch or not watch if they do not have enough information upon which to base those decisions they should insist that their elected representatives act on those needs one of the presidents roles is to host events that involve arts and entertainment who would you ask to sing the national anthem at your inauguration who would you choose to give a reading are there particular artists the first family would invite to the white house or arts you would draw attention to as president first there is no constitutional obligation for the president to do what your question implies that said supporting and advocating for appreciation of the arts is important to an informed and aware society as president i would take on that role as for identifying people to sing read or invite to the white house i will not identify them to save them from the media storm that would surely come it would not be fair to them a significant part of the presidency is communicating with the public so how would your administration approach the media would representatives of the administration sit in on interviews between government officials and reporters under what circumstances would you initiate leak investigations how would your administration handle whistleblowers will you allow news photographers the same access as official white house photographers you are asking for answers to hypotheticals that cannot be answered until such time as my administration is in place and is able to assess security and access issues as for transparency it will not take much to improve of this administration i promise a transparent administration with as much access as is reasonable for circumstances as for whistleblowers we are proposing a total revamp of the inspector general system to include putting in place an inspector general for the entire executive branch i will work with senator grassley and others to make sure we protect whistleblowers we want better government and governance the federal government administers a large network of museums the smithsonian institution what will your priorities for the smithsonian be during your time in office i will work with congress to address the most pressing priorities of the people through our budgeting processes appropriate actions based on circumstances will determine outcomes for all agencies under the control of the federal government

transfer happening which is vulnerable to cyber threats as well the cloud can work as a catalyst to make iot work and for that there has to be a right kind of framework that can assist it the grc governance risk management and compliance guidelines can play an important part to make iot work in a proper manner ghosh said india is currently a small iot market but with great potential we will definitely see a great development in the country on the iot front in the coming years lundquist pointed out for oracles shailendra kumar rural india is set to transform itself by taking the technology leap and adopting real life solutions like iot 
techno skeptics objection growing louder astra taylors iphone has a cracked screen she has bandaged it with clear packing tape and plans to use the phone until it disintegrates she objects to the planned obsolescence of todays gadgetry and to the way the big tech companies pressure customers to upgrade taylor 36 is a documentary filmmaker musician and political activist shes also an emerging star in the world of technology criticism shes not paranoid but she keeps duct tape over the camera lens on her laptop computer   because as everyone knows these gadgets can be taken over by nefarious agents of all kinds taylor is a 21st century digital dissenter shes one of the many technophiles unhappy about the way the tech revolution has played out political progressives once embraced the utopian promise of the internet as a democratizing force but theyve been dismayed by the rise of the surveillance state and the near monopolization of digital platforms by huge corporations last month taylor and more than 1000 activists scholars and techies gathered at the new school in new york city for a conference to talk about reinventing the internet they dream of a co op model people dealing directly with one another without having to go through a data sucking corporate hub the powerful definitely do not want us to reboot things and they will go to great lengths to stop us from doing so and they will use brute force or they will use bureaucracy taylor warned the conferees at the close of the two day session we need a movement she said that says no to the existing order the dissenters have no easy task were in a new machine age machine intelligence and digital social networks are now embedded in the basic infrastructure of the developed world much of this is objectively good and pleasurable and empowering we tend to like our devices our social media our computer games we like our connectivity we like being able to know nearly anything and everything or shop impulsively by typing a few words into a search engine but theres this shadow narrative being written at the same time its a passionate if still remarkably disorganized resistance to the digital establishment techno skeptics or whatever you want to call them   humanists may be the best term   sense that human needs are getting lost in the tech frenzy that the priorities have been turned upside down they sense that theres too much focus on making sure that new innovations will be good for the machines im on team human author douglas rushkoff will say at the conclusion of a talk you could fill a college syllabus with books espousing some kind of technological resistance start the class with you are not a gadget jaron lanier move on to the internet is not the answer andrew keen and then to scare the students silly our final invention artificial intelligence and the end of the human era james barrat somewhere in the mix should be astra taylors the peoples platform taking back power and culture in the digital age a clear eyed reappraisal of the internet and new media of the myriad critiques of the computer culture one of the most common is that companies are getting rich off our personal data our thoughts friendships and basic urges are processed by computer algorithms and sold to advertisers the machines may soon know more about us than we know about ourselves that information is valuable a frequent gibe is that on facebook were not the customers were the merchandise or to put it another way if the service is free youre the product some digital dissenters arent focused on the economic issues but simply on the nature of human machine interactions this is an issue we all understand intuitively were constantly distracted we walk around with our eyes cast down upon our devices were rarely fully present anywhere other critics are alarmed by the erosion of privacy the edward snowden revelations incited widespread fear of government surveillance that debate has been complicated by the terrorist attacks in paris and san bernardino because national security officials say terrorists have exploited new types of encrypted social media some dissenters think technology is driving economic inequality there are grave concerns that robots are taking the jobs of humans and the robot issue leads inevitably to the most apocalyptic fear that machine intelligence could run away from its human inventors leaving us enslaved   or worse   by the machines we created moving rapidly technological skepticism isnt new plato told the story of a king who protested the invention of writing saying it would weaken his peoples memory and implant forgetfulness in their souls but something different is going on now and it simply has to do with speed the first commercial internet browser hit the market in 1994 google arrived in 1998 twitter appeared in 2006 and the iphone in 2007 facebook founder mark zuckerberg is all of 31 years old our technology today is so new that we havent had time to understand how to use it wisely we havent quite learned how to stop ourselves from texting and driving many of us are tempted to tap out one more letter even if were going 75 on the highway some countries are taking aggressive action to regulate new technologies the south korean government has decided that gaming is so addictive that it should be treated similarly to a drug or alcohol problem meanwhile the european union law right to be forgotten forces companies such as google and yahoo to remove embarrassing material from search engine results if requested to do so washingtons political establishment however has largely deferred to silicon valley the tech world skews libertarian and doesnt want more government oversight and regulations one of the tech worlds top advocates in washington is robert atkinson president of the information technology  innovation foundation which receives about two thirds of its funding from tech companies atkinson is a lanky voluble man who sounds exasperated by the rise in what he considers to be neo luddite thinking luddite is a term dating to the early 19th century named for a murky character named ned ludd who inspired textile workers to smash mechanical looms hes worried that books by people such as astra taylor will create a thought contagion that will infect washington policymaking in his view there are two types of luddites the old fashioned hand wringers who are spooked by anything new and innovative and the soft luddites   he would put taylor in that category   who say they embrace technology but want to go slower with more european style regulations its the emergence of soft luddites that i worry about because it has become the elite conventional wisdom in a lot of spaces atkinson said but he may be worried prematurely a senate bill to regulate self driving cars went precisely nowhere its not as though people are marching on washington to demand that lawmakers address the self driving car threat fact in fiction the technological resistance is not limited to nonfiction polemics fiction writers are picking up the thread often borrowing from george orwell and his dystopian masterpiece 1984 for example gary shteyngarts super sad true love story is a tale of people struggling to find love and humanity in a world of big brother like surveillance societal breakdown and increasingly coarse social norms the novel features gadgets that allow people to rate one another numerically on their sexual attractiveness not implausible a start up company recently announced its plan to market an app that would allow users to rate everyone on a 1 to 5 scale without their consent after furious protest from around the internet the backers modified their plan to include only positive reviews dave eggerss novel the circle tells of a rising star at a google like company she excels by answering thousands of emails a day working at a frenetic pace she lives with a camera around her neck that streams everything she sees onto the internet this does not go well for her and theres a new voice among the dissenters pope francis the pontiffs recent encyclical on care for our common home contemplates the mixed blessings of technology after acknowledging the marvels of modern technology who can deny the beauty of an aircraft or a skyscraper francis sketched the dangers writing that technological development hasnt been matched by development in human values and conscience the economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings he wrote the pontiff is saying with his special authority what many others are saying these days machines are not an end unto themselves remember the humans becoming a dissenter the dean of the digital dissenters is jaron lanier hes a musician composer performer and pioneer of virtual reality headsets that allow the user to experience computer generated 3d environments but what hes most famous for is his criticism of the computer culture he helped create he believes that silicon valley treats humans like electrical relays in a vast machine although he still works in technology he largely has turned against his tribe im the first guy to sober up after a heavy duty party is how he describes himself he can typically be found at home in californias berkeley hills swiveling in a chair in front of a computer screen and a musical synthesizer directly behind him is a vintage wurlitzer golden harp lutes and violins hang from the ceiling this is his home office and man cave lanier 55 is a man of considerable girth and extraordinary hair he has dreadlocks to his waist he hasnt cut his hair for at least 30 years and says he wouldnt know how to go about it when a visitor suggests that he could see a barber he replies in his usual high pitched singsong voice i dont know that term is that a new start up laniers humanistic take on technology may trace back to his tragic childhood he was 9 when his mother was killed in a car accident in el paso he later learned that the accident may have been caused by an engineering flaw in the car it definitely influenced my thinking about the proper relationship of people and machines he said by age 14 he was taking college classes at new mexico state university he never graduated from college which didnt matter when he wound up in silicon valley designing computer games he eventually started a company that sold virtual reality headsets but the company folded in 2000 he made his first major move as a digital dissenter when he published an essay one half a manifesto that began with a bold declaration for the last twenty years i have found myself on the inside of a revolution but on the outside of its resplendent dogma now that the revolution has not only hit the mainstream but bludgeoned it into submission by taking over the economy its probably time for me to cry out my dissent more loudly than i have before lanier later wrote two books lamenting the way everyone essentially works for facebook google etc by feeding material into those central processors and turning private lives into something corporations can monetize hed like to see people compensated for their data in the form of micropayments other tech critics have rolled their eyes at that notion however taylor for example fears that micropayments would create an incentive for people to post click bait material stupid stunts   hold my beer and watch this   would be potentially marketable laniers broadest argument is that technological change involves choices bad decisions will lock us into bad systems we collectively decided for example to trade our privacy for free internet service its a choice its not inevitable he says lanier told his 8 year old daughter recently in our society there are two paths to success one is to be good at computers and the other is to be a sociopath shes a smart girl and knows what sociopath means he said and he understands the nature of this world that he has helped invent thats why this summer he sent his daughter to a software programming camp no coherent movement much of todays tech environment emerged from the counterculture   the hackers and hippies of the 1960s and 70s who viewed the personal computer as a tool of liberation but the political left now has a more complicated jaundiced relationship with the digital world the same technologies that empower individuals and enable protesters to organize also make it possible for governments to spy on their citizens what used to be a phone now looks to many people like a tracking device then theres the question of whos making money progressives are appalled by the mind boggling profits of the big tech companies the left also takes note of the gender and racial disparities in the tech companies and the rise of a techno elite most painful for progressives has been the rise of the sharing economy which they initially embraced they feel as though the idea was stolen from them and perverted into something that hurts workers they say that companies such as uber airbnb taskrabbit and amazon mechanical turk are creating a gig economy   one that although it offers customers convenience and reasonable prices is built on freelancers and contractors who lack the income or job protections of salaried employees amazon founder jeffrey p bezos  an investor in uber and airbnb owns the washington post what was billed as sharing was actually extraction  said nathan schneider a journalist and co organizer of the recent new school conference on cooperative platforms its revealed to be a way of shirking labor laws and extracting resources back to investors and building monopolies he was speaking at a reception at the end of the two day conference the event was a huge success with attentive audiences packing the panel discussions these people are committed to reinventing the internet the story of the internet has been one of disappointment after disappointment schneider said as schneider spoke astra taylor stood a few feet away holding court with friends and allies taylor is tall with striking features that give her a commanding presence she was born to be a tech critic she wasnt home schooled she was unschooled her parents in athens ga put her in charge of her education at age 13 she created her own newspaper with an environmentalist bent she burned with a sense of right and wrong i was a serious child she says persuasively she says shed like to see more government supported media platforms   think public radio   and more robust regulations to keep digital powerhouses from becoming monopolies taylor is skeptical of the trope that information wants to be free actually she says information often wants someone to pay for it the internet she said is a bit like a friend who needs to be straightened out she imagines giving the internet a talking to you know internet weve known you for a long time and we think youre not living up to your potential you keep making the same mistakes the final event at the new school conference featured a stemwinder of a talk by someone taylor considers a mentor douglas im on team human rushkoff rushkoff whose upcoming book is titled throwing rocks at the google bus provided a primer on the rise of capitalism central banks and industrial culture he suggested that civilization started making wrong turns in the middle ages centralized currency   not good in the early days every community could have its own coinage we need to rebirth the values of the peer to peer bazaar culture growing louder and more animated as his lecture went on he talked about the need to optimize the economy for humans where do humans fit into this new economy he said really not as creators of value but as the content we are the content we are the data we are the media as you use a smartphone your smartphone gets smarter but you get dumber taylor rushkoff lanier and other tech skeptics do not yet form an organized coherent movement theyre more like a confederation of gadflies even pope franciss thoughts on technology were largely lost amid his headline grabbing views about climate change andrew keen author of the internet is not the answer sounds a glum note when talking about what the technological resistance might accomplish no ones ever heard of astra taylor he said he didnt mean that as an insult he was making a point about the whole crew of dissenters no one he said has ever heard of andrew keen either the world is not about to go back to the stone age at least not willingly one billion people may use facebook on any given day jaron lanier may not like the way the big companies scrape value from our lives but people are participating in that system willingly   if perhaps not entirely aware of what is happening to their data taylors smartphone with the cracked screen clearly has been in heavy use she knows these gadgets are addictive by design   like las vegas slot machines in our pockets but she also has trouble living without one i need to learn to turn it off she said 
ill stress importance of looted jewish property britain may soon begin a public relations campaign to convince poles of the importance of holocaust restitution according to prime minister david camerons post holocaust issues envoy sir eric pickles interviewed in jerusalem during a short visit here the conservative mp and former secretary of state for communities and local government appeared bullish on the possibilities of overcoming decades of reluctance in warsaw to engage in serious restitution work last year 50 british mps sent a letter to then polish prime minister donald tusk demanding the passage of a restitution law according to the world jewish restitution organization a generation after the fall of communist regimes many holocaust victims and their families are still fighting for the return of their property from poland and other countries in central and eastern europe pickles will be the first to admit that he is anything but shy and retiring with the chairman of conservative friends of israel having recently publicly criticized the british foreign office of turning a blind eye to palestinian incitement of violence it is this outspoken candor that he wishes to bring to bear on holocaust matters he said you can kind of understand a lot of property issues there are very complex not just in terms of the war but also in terms of the involvement of the communist regime but when it comes down to it fundamentally the nazis were thieves they were gangsters they stole your right to work they stole your tools of the trade they stole your property they stole your clothes they stole your identity and they tried to remove you from history and so long as there are items out there that havent been restored to their rightful owners then a little bit of the holocaust holds on to individuals pickles said it might be the signature on the flyleaf of a book and that might be the only evidence that a grandchild has of what their grandparents signature actually looked like it might be things that are immensely personal and i think it would be  as we start to move in that period where people who had direct and personal experience of the holocaust start to disappear  i think we need to give it a push asked about his plans for the future pickles replied that were looking at a number of particular properties that have been lost and are out on public display and i think i might make a little bit of fuss about them we think its time that there should be a wider knowledge about them and well be doing something about that reasonably soon regarding how he plans on making progress after decades of stalled efforts he believes that there has been disengagement with the public i think sometimes this has been forgotten and i think we need to raise the level of peoples understanding about this there are more ways of getting to a particular problem than just appealing to government he said suggesting a pr campaign in poland pickles also indicated that britain which has thus far not taken a hard stance on recent data protection legislation in the european parliament that has drawn the ire of holocaust historians may be changing its tune the international holocaust remembrance alliance has been lobbying legislators and bureaucrats in brussels since 2012 over the wording of a small portion of the general data protection regulation a measure being touted by policy makers as creating a right to be forgotten for eu citizens my recommendation is that we should support it pickles said of the ihra amendment when asked about recent eu labeling guidelines for settlement products pickles came out strongly against any boycott of israel weve had a system of labeling in the uk of israeli goods and other goods since 2009 during that period the amount of trade that weve done with israel has doubled my own view about it is that its simple if youre going to have something about disputed occupation of land well theres plenty of other places to look at theres crimea theres parts of the ukraine theres bits of cyprus lets have a degree of reciprocity he said we are totally and utterly opposed to a boycott well be changing our laws to ensure that public bodies cannot engage in a boycott were issuing guidance to public bodies  local authorities  who are quite big investors that they cant use that to disinvest in israel people need to understand that israel and the united kingdom have a pretty integrated economy one out of six of every medical prescription comes from an israeli patent were doing enormous work on the heart on diabetes on alzheimers its not just about trading on arms its about the nature and israel is a vital and important ally in the middle east and we should hold her dear 
apcs priorities for the 10th internet governance forum brazil 2015 by apc apc 1 preamble the 10th annual internet governance forum  igf  will be held in joo pessoa brazil from 10 to 13 november 2015 with the overall theme of evolution of internet governance empowering sustainable development over the past 10 years the igf has matured into more than an annual meeting aside from its contribution to regional and national igf s across the globe igf intersessional work is producing substantial outputs in 2015 six best practice forums tackled issues ranging from countering abuse of women online to policy options for connecting the next billion  not to mention the ongoing work of the dynamic coalitions these initiatives have produced outcome documents that will enrich discussions at the igf and inform policy making elsewhere in the internet governance ecosystem the igfs mandate ends this year with its fate to be determined by the un general assembly on 15 and 16 december apc s view is that the igf is an invaluable mechanism for capacity building networking between different stakeholder groups identifying emerging internet policy issues facilitating inter institutional interaction and identifying solutions to internet policy and regulation problems for civil society it provides an opportunity to network exchange knowledge connect local and global dimensions and strategise on how to improve the governance of the internet so that it serves the public interest we recommend that the igf s operational capacity be strengthened and that its mandate be renewed for another 15 years the 2015 igf has added significance for apc as it takes place in the year of apc s 25th anniversary and in the home country of one of apc s founders carlos afonso the apc community and our many friends and allies will celebrate this achievement in joo pessoa 2 key internet related political developments since igf 2014 the past year has seen a number of developments in legislation regulation and normative frameworks affecting internet policy as well as the 10 year review of the wsis and the finalisation of the post 2015 development agenda 21 developments in the un at the un level key developments include the establishment of a new special rapporteur on the right to privacy whose mandate includes technology related challenges to privacy the new un special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression david kaye issued a groundbreaking report establishing encryption and anonymity as key enablers of human rights as well as a report on protection of whistleblowers and sources the human rights council  hrc  recognised for the first time that cyber bullying and cyber stalking as a pattern can constitute violence against women and the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women  cedaw  issued a general recommendation on access to justice which includes substantial reference to information and communications technologies  ict s and recommends that states take specific measures to protect women against internet crimes and misdemeanours 22 wsis 10 and the future of the igf the igf is an outcome of the world summit on the information society  which is undergoing a 10 year review  a process which as stated above involves the un general assembly making a decision on the future of the igf the wsis 10 process has been useful in refocusing the internet communitys attention on development concerns and alerting those involved in the post 2015 development agenda of the critical linkages between sustainable development and information and communications apc strongly recommends renewing the igfs mandate for another 15 years a 15 year mandate is critical for ensuring that the igf is adequately funded as well as ensuring its integration with the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development we recommend that the igf continue using intersessional work as a mechanism for consolidating the learning and information exchange that takes place at the annual global forum and at linked national and regional igf s we believe that the igf can play a stronger role where appropriate in making recommendations and that this will emerge from bpf s and the ongoing improvement of the igf but we also believe that the igf should not become a negotiating or policy making forum we recommend that in future the relationship between the igf  the united nations department of economic and social affairs  undesa  and other un agencies be strengthened and expanded to included un women the united nations development programme  undp  the office of the high commissioner for human rights  ohchr  and other agencies involved in the implementation of the sustainable development goals  sdg s apc is organising a pre event on wsis  together with the internet democracy project and the international federation of library associations and institutions to explore whether the 10 year review is moving forward in a way that will help us come closer to the wsis goal of a people centred development oriented inclusive information society we welcome the fact that the co facilitators of the wsis 10 overall review ambassador jnis maeiks of latvia and ambassador lana nusseibeh of the united arab emirates will be attending the igf and participating in a main session on wsis 10 that will allow members of the igf community to share their views on the draft outcome document we encourage the co facilitators to take advantage of their time in brazil to experience the unique nature of the igf by attending workshops pre events and the variety of activities that the igf encompasses 23 increased legislation regulation and judicial cases addressing internet policy at the national and regional levels at the national level courts and legislatures have continued to grapple with complex policy matters that impact internet rights to mention just a few examples france passed a sweeping new surveillance law in may that allows authorities to collect and analyse metadata on millions of web users and forces them to make that data freely available to intelligence organisations and is considering another piece of legislation that would legalise mass surveillance beyond frances borders in pakistan the national assembly is on the verge of adopting a new cybercrime bill  the prevention of electronic crimes bill which would give the government and law enforcement agencies broad and sweeping powers to curtail free speech online and violate the online privacy of citizens in south africa the film and publication board is considering a draft regulation that poses serious threats to online freedom of expression under the guise of child protection and in october 2015 during country wide student protests against university fee increases the high court issued an interdict against the hashtag feesmustfall a south korean court recently ruled that google should disclose the history of users personal data provided to a third party in india the shreya singhal v union of india supreme court decision on sections of the information technology act of 2000 has major implications for online censorship intermediary liability and blocking of communications services in brazil while the passing of the marco civil da internet civil rights framework for the internet in 2014 was a huge achievement some of its provisions remain contested while others are still not being implemented effectively of particular concern is draft bill 2152015 which among other provisions would add to the marco civil the so called right to be forgotten this move is considered dangerous by internet rights advocates as it goes beyond the european concept of the right to be forgotten for removal not only de indexing of content associated to someones name or image referring to a crime acquitted or that could be considered defamatory calumnious or infamous to the person as such it is seen as a potential threat to the rights to information and freedom of expression it is important to note that although these rights need to be balanced with the right to privacy due to the history of corruption in the country and the fact that brazil does not even have a bill on data protection this provision has been interpreted as an attempt to protect politicians rather than advance the right to privacy or other rights regionally the european court of justice has ruled invalid the us eu safe harbor agreement relied on by thousands of companies including all the major tech giants to transfer personal data to the united states the court found that the arrangement infringes on europeans rights to privacy late last month the european parliament voted not to adopt amendments that would have brought clarity to the net neutrality regulation and allows for providers to be allowed to offer specialised services at higher speeds than standard services and to offer zero ratingthe future of net neutrality in europe is tied to guidelines that will be prepared by the committee of european regulators  berec  which will give a binding interpretation to the ambiguous text and answer many questions about what real effects this regulation will have on freedom of expression and innovation in europe 24 threats to online expression threats to internet rights have continued from both state and non state actors governments have blocked access to online content social media platforms or communications networks entirely in particular ahead of elections or in times of political and social instability for example in malaysia  turkey the host of last years igf  india and burundi  among others bloggers and human rights defenders continue to be jailed and murdered with impunity including in mexico host country of the 2016 igf in bangladesh attacks on bloggers and publishers reached an alarming rate in 2015 with seven attacks this year alone five of them fatal scores of human rights defenders who use the internet in their work remain imprisoned including apc partners alaa abdel fattah and khadija ismayilova take back the tech  apc s collaborative campaign calling on women and girls to use technology to end violence against women  vaw  recently faced attacks on twitter simply for working on this issue the misinformation and intimidation campaign against take back the tech and its broad network of women activists and survivors included attempts to shut down the work of the igf bpf on countering abuse against women online the attackers conflate work on violence against women with efforts to dismantle freedom of expression and anonymity ignoring that take back the tech was part of a coalition that successfully pressured facebook to make changes to its real name policy which exposes vaw survivors and others at risk of violence to those who would abuse them by forcing them to use their real names 25 access bridging the digital divide and net neutrality net neutrality and the expansion of zero rated services have been topics of intense debate this year in india facebooks internetorg and airtelorg sparked such intense criticism and debate that when the telecom regulatory authority of india opened up a public consultation on the matter it received over a million emails although the government has yet to reach a final decision on the matter the department of telecommunications has indicated that it considers internetorg to be in violation of net neutrality in response to severe criticism facebook rebranded internetorg as free basics  which adjusts aspects of the service but does not fundamentally change the walled garden nature of the project on a positive note in the united states after years of advocacy from public interest groups the federal communications commission voted in favour of net neutrality however despite this major development cable companies and others are taking a number of measures to undermine the net neutrality rules the question of how to bridge the digital divide is not a new one but has seen increased attention this year in september the worlds governments adopted the sustainable development goals  which call for significantly increased access to information and communications technology and universal and affordable access to the internet in least developed countries by 2020 and mention the importance of ict s for womens empowerment higher education and science technology and innovation the agenda for sustainable development also calls for the establishment of the technology facilitation mechanism which will consist of a un inter agency task team on science technology and innovation for the sdg s a collaborative annual multistakeholder forum on science technology and innovation  sti  and an online platform as a gateway for information on existing sti initiatives mechanisms and programmes 26 iana transition and icann accountability the iana stewardship transition coordination group  icg  has issued a report with its recommendation on how to transition the management of aspects of the domain name system away from the us national telecommunications and information administration  ntia  the icg proposal calls for the creation of a new legal entity the post transition iana  pti  which would handle iana functions as an icann subsidiary this proposal needs to be paired with the icann cross community working group on accountability recommendation and its implementation before it can be approved by the ntia there has been some criticism about the fact that the improvement in icann accountability will involve internal multistakeholder mechanisms as opposed to external oversight any external oversight however would meet opposition from the us government and was never part of the possible solution the iana transition was initially supposed to conclude by september 2015 but ntia has granted an extension of a year on the contract the extension can be prolonged for as long as an additional three years if necessary further extensions however are seen as problematic in terms of us elections in 2016 and a possible change of administration 3 apc s priorities at igf 2015 31 human rights human rights issues ranging from speech online eg blasphemy hate and dangerous speech to the implications for privacy of big data and the internet of things to content control lgbt rights and online activism will be covered at the igf 2015 by a main session and the approximately 38 workshops that touch on human rights related topics 1 usefully  and demonstrating the practical value of the igf  there are workshops that will focus on the implementation and measurement of human rights online through for example implementing core principles ranking and benchmarking ict companies and building internet observatories we note that there is still a gap in discussing economic social and cultural rights at the igf given the recognition that the internet has a significant impact on the right to education health culture an adequate standard of living and other rights it is time that greater attention be given to how internet policy and regulation can help achieve greater social inclusion priorities apc is organising co organising or participating in a number of workshops and pre events with the goals to jointly create a set of principles to guide the development of mechanisms to prevent and respond to technology related vaw through the igf bpf on countering the abuse of women online and a pre event on gender and the internet the pre event will provide space to build understanding of technology related vaw as a freedom of expression issue and to examine responses from states and intermediaries shed light on the practical steps that people can take to protect themselves and their activism through disco tech a peer learning session we are organising together with coding rights and tactical tech on 9 november apc will also participate in meetings of the dynamic coalitions on internet rights and principles and on platform responsibility as well as the best bits pre even 32 access approximately 20 workshops 2 will address aspects of access such as capacity building and investment enabling policy environments measuring access producing data to inform policy community owned infrastructure and access to content apc s priorities with regard to access are to promote public internet access facilities access for women and girls access to radio spectrum infrastructure sharing and integrated national broadband planning we believe that addressing gender and access to the internet requires a broad based approach that considers economic social political and cultural contexts and existing inequalities find ways to minimise barriers to entry for access providers through new technologies better and targeted subsidies direct investment in infrastructure roll out and more effective transparent and accountable public private partnerships we would like to see a stronger response from states to establish effective access through for example investing in public access in libraries and community centres facilitating community owned networks and promoting net neutrality and non discriminatory access in addition to support for capacity and content development relevant applications and an enabling cultural economic and political environment encourage a rights based approach to access people need to be involved in policy development and decision making processes to ensure they meet real and expressed needs take broader social and economic divides into account acknowledge that there are barriers beyond the technical ones and put the human dimension at their centre apc has also been contributing to intersessional work in the dynamic coalition on public access in libraries and on policy options for connecting the next billion 33 fostering good internet governance and enhancing multistakeholder cooperation approximately 17 workshops 3 specifically reference the multistakeholder approach multistakeholder cooperation will also be addressed by the main session on the netmundial statement and the evolution of the internet governance ecosystem and the bpf on strengthening multistakeholder participation multistakeholder participation in internet governance has evolved and it needs to evolve further to be fully democratic inclusive transparent and accountable more effort needs to be made to bring a diversity of voices into internet governance discussions in particular from developing countries and from vulnerable and marginalised communities but recognising the need for improving multistakeholder processes should not undermine affirmation of the principle nor should support of multistakeholder processes be interpreted as denial of the need for regulation or of the important role of governments in creating an enabling environment for social justice and development and protecting human rights enhanced cooperation and multistakeholder internet governance are not mutually exclusive they are mutually reinforcing we recommend that any initiatives to establish spaces for discussion and cooperation among governments with regard to internet governance be linked to the igf process there is a need for a normative framework to consolidate transparent accountable and inclusive decision making  that puts the public interest first  across the internet governance ecosystem the net mundial principles on internet governance agreed on by multiple stakeholders in 2014 was a giant step towards achieving this we recommend that the igf consider using and disseminating the net mundial principles as a basis for common principles and guidelines for internet policy making at all levels the igf community should focus on establishing inclusive democratic transparent and accountable internet governance processes that involve all stakeholders and that are based on an understanding of the internet as a global public resource which should be governed in the public interest at national regional and global levels 34 net neutrality a dynamic coalition on the issue of net neutrality was formed in 2013 and has made substantial contributions to addressing its nuances and diverse angles it is an issue on which consensus is hard to build as different actors have different interests and therefore views the fact that the igf 2015 is dedicating a session to a dialogue on zero rating and network neutrality and that four workshops will discuss it from different perspectives is an indicator of its significance the essence of the network neutrality and zero rating debate can be framed by three key questions to what extent should internet access providers the operators of the pipes be allowed to interfere with the content that flows through them and by extension how rigidly should the end to end principle be observed and to what extent should content providers be allowed to come to agreements with access providers to subsidise their content these questions are particularly relevant to developing country contexts where access happens mostly through mobile networks and is expensive and there are fewer if any alternatives for low cost access zero rating not charging users for data related costs when using specific platforms through an agreement between the mobile operator and the platform may be motivated by good intentions and there is research that indicates it drives demand for mobile data services but does this offset the potential harmful impacts zero rating services of established global platforms can impact negatively on smaller or newly emerging content and application providers in the context of increasing vertical integration where access and content providers are owned by the same companies these strategies can result in abuse of market power research should be conducted to determine the extent of net neutrality abuses and zero rating activities that are taking place in order to inform public policy responses and there is a need to look at the relationship between net neutrality and human rights such as freedom of expression privacy and access to knowledge 35 cyber security and trust eleven workshops will talk about cyber security issues at the igf 4 they look at the intersection of human rights and cyber security how to build trust managing cyber threats maintaining online identities sharing national experiences and offering new models for capacity building our participation in workshops and discussions on cyber security and trust at the igf will focus on advancing the following cyber security approaches that are inclusive of all stakeholders and proactively ensure that cyber security policies are from their inception rights respecting and consistent with the international human rights framework apc rejects the false dichotomy of security versus rights since human rights and security are mutually reinforcing internet protocols and standards that take into account rights ramifications in addition to the technical context of the security and resilience of the network privacy as a key pillar in building frameworks of trust and capacity building in the context of cyber security apc will continue to focus on the right to privacy in order to address the issue of mass surveillance and demand that the necessary and proportionate principles be applied to the technical architecture of communications and surveillance systems preserving strong encryption and other applications enabled by cryptography which serve a critical role in enabling the exercise of rights online we are deeply concerned by attempts to weaken sabotage or ban cryptographic protocols that enable privacy online apc believes that the igf community should support and build on the recommendations made by the un special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression david kaye in his report on the use of encryption and anonymity in the digital age apc is alarmed by the increasing discourse we are seeing that cyberspace is the fifth domain of war civilians particularly those living in war affected areas depend on communications infrastructure for their health safety and security we believe unequivocally that the internet should be a demilitarised space a demilitarised internet contributes towards international peace safety and stability furthermore terms like cyber warfare cyber attacks and cyber weapons can be misleading in many instances cyber weapons and cyber attacks can be indistinguishable from exploits and methods used in cyber crime a secure internet infrastructure should be able to secure civilians from all forms of exploits regardless of who the actor is 36 gender and internet governance apc has been committed to cross movement building working on bringing more womens rights and sexual rights activists into internet governance as well as opening up the internet governance spaces at national regional and international levels to the views and concerns of gender and sexuality activists as part of our work in the gender dynamic coalition we have been working with the igf secretariat since 2012 to carry out the gender report card to monitor and assess the level of gender parity at the annual global igf we have found that while there have been more women in the room more effort is needed to ensure that women are present as moderators and panellists and not simply as participants of equal importance is to have diversity within the gender category itself and include considerations of sexual orientation geographies languages ethnicities and generation it is significant that the 2014 findings show an improvement in terms of how the organisers made the link between gender and internet governance with 15 workshops reporting gender being mentioned apc will also participate in the dynamic coalition on gender and internet governance 37 global information society watch 2015  gisw atch apc is launching global information society watch 2015  gisw atch our annual joint publication with hivos on 12 november this years edition covers sexual rights and the internet  with reports ranging from the challenges and possibilities that the internet offers lesbian gay bisexual transgender and intersex  lgbti  communities to the active role of religious cultural and patriarchal establishments in suppressing sexual rights including same sex marriage to the rights of sex workers violence against women online and sex education in schools 38 strengthening the impact of regional and national igf s apc has been participating in igf s at all levels based on our view that stronger and more sustained national level multistakeholder participation will in turn inform regional and global processes and help address the current gaps in participation and influence between stakeholder groups and between people from developing and developed countries we will strive to use igf 2015 to more effectively integrate regional and national perspectives into the global dialogue in 2015 apc helped organise andor participated in the following regional and national igf s asia pacific igf  held in macau in junejuly 2015 africa igf  held in addis ababa in

colombia igf  held in bogota in september 2015 south africa igf  held in stellenbosch in september 2015 paraguay igf  held in asuncion in november 2015 39 capacity building in internet governance in the last year apc has invested considerable resources in linking our capacity building work in internet governance to regional igf s guided by the belief that such efforts are needed to enable stakeholders from developing countries to participate effectively in internet governance processes and debates at the national regional and global level we held our third annual african school on internet governance afrisig ahead of the african igf  which gave alumni the opportunity to immediately try out the skills they gained in recognition that there is a gap in participation by womens rights advocates in internet governance policy processes and development nationally regionally and globally in every sector and stakeholder group apc began a new initiative  gender and internet governance exchanges gigx  in 2015 to strengthen the capacity and confidence of women and girls to participate in internet governance processes we held gigxs ahead of the asia pacific african and lac igf s involving more than 50 women to discuss and build awareness and understanding of the relationship between gender womens rights and internet governance we are pleased that a large number of afrisig and gigx alumni will be at the 2015 igf 4 apc s presence at igf 2015 5 follow apc online at igf 2015 useful background reading before the igf in brazil in depth resources on our publications

the social web and the digital panopticon arthur chu crunch network contributor arthur chu is a lifelong geek who catapulted into notoriety in 2014 for hacking the game show jeopardy and has been commenting about nerd culture in the digital age ever since i dont much care for modern yellow peril stories such stories rely on the fact that china is a foreign country with a billion and a half people in it that still reflexively scares americans it makes it very easy to write alarmist trend pieces where a few headlines get blown up into a story about how a whole country is filled with drivers intentionally killing pedestrians they hit to avoid lawsuits or whatnot even so i approve for the most part of the coverage of chinas social credit system  with the government paying tech companies to scour through everything they can find of a citizens financial and professional history use secret sauce algorithms to turn that history into a flat numerical score and then make that score available to the general public for the purpose of everyone being able to judge everyone else sure the coverage is to a degree exaggerated there are no plans yet to use scs comprehensively crunch the numbers on how liked or disliked you are on social media how loyal or disloyal you are to the government how of your friends are the right or wrong people etc but the technology to do so clearly exists and companies are experimenting with social network credit scores in many places including china the chinese government isnt using big data algorithms to automatically detect dissident thought before it happens a la minority report as far as we know but scouring through your entire financial professional and legal history to tell all future employers whether you can be trusted with a job is surely scary enough chinas scs is only a mild extrapolation of where our societys lust for big data is already taking us were scared at the thought of that kind of power being in the hands of a foreign authoritarian government without noticing that thats power already held by unaccountable private actors here in the free west interestingly china and the united states have this in commontheyre both in favor of relatively unrestricted data hoovering of their citizens done to build big data model of those citizens to predict their behavior and control it with incentives its just that chinas oligopoly of companies doing the data mining are acting under the explicit direction of the state whereas in the united states its more often the state acting under the implicit direction of the oligopoly complaints about fico scoring and the concept of a credit rating arent new ive been following one of my favorite bloggers fred clark fighting the good fight against the experianequifaxtransunion protection racket for years its bad enough that for as long as ive been alive shady corporations have had the power to dig up dirt on me and then charge me for the privilege of seeing or challenging any of that dirt before they use it to possibly ruin my life up till now weve had regulations restricting what kind of information can go into a credit report and what kind of information can come out of it scs proposes to ignore such petty consumer protections vacuuming up everything from points on your drivers license to negative performance reviews at your last job and spitting out a numerical score that anyone at all can look up  not just potential landlords and employers but potential romantic partners roommates neighbors or random strangers who want to attack your reputation scs is drawing attention because its being pushed by the same people who erected the great firewall of china people whom the internet can mobilize against as enemies of freedom enemies of the future enemies of the west etc but make no mistake about it the oppressive world that scs implies the orwellian nightmare of being constantly surveilled and constantly judged is not an attack on the internet as it currently exists its the internets logical endpoint what data broker sites like spokeo clumsily try to pretend to do china simply wants to do for real as with so many other complex metaphors from the past foucaults idea of the  panopticon  in discipline and punish has become depressingly easy to explain because the internet has made it depressingly literal foucault said you can build a prison without walls just by letting your prisoner know hes always being watched in real life in 2015 you can totally control someones behavior by training them to tweet or instagram every tiny thing they do and see how many likes it gets foucault said you can have a jail without any jailers as long as all the prisoners know there might be someone watching at all times even if they cant see who it is in real life in 2015 we can all be each others wardens as members of the amorphous mob that hands out likes and dislikes indeed the only way to not feel totally helpless in the face of the invisible mobs upvotes and downvotes is to aggressively participate in voting yourselfand so like the crabs in the bucket we all cooperate in crowdsourced self imprisonment does this sound overwrought melodramatic does it trigger an urge in you to say its just online bs just dont read the comments well consider that even though new york city can enact a law against employers pulling credit checks against you no one can do anything to stop a hiring manager from google stalking you consider hiring managers outright admitting that finding negative remarks about you on social media from people they dont know can still sink your chances of a job offer consider the stories of people like lindsey stone losing their jobs after a tasteless photo went massively viral consider organized attempts to leak information from peoples private lives nude photos from a romantic relationship  a past career in sex work in order to poison their reputation in their future careers even though new york city can enact a law against employers pulling credit checks against you no one can do anything to stop a hiring manager from google stalking you look at the world of yelp reviews which makes drama over hits to ones credit rating look tame look at the cutthroat warfare of retaliating to bad reviews with bad reviews we see small businesses engaging in look at how one possibly faked review can lead to an explosion of one star reviews and negative press look at how the fear people have of a damaged credit rating leads to profits for companies that sell access to your credit reportnow look at the far greater fear companies have of yelps power over them leading to allegations of  yelp mafia  tactics of filtering negative reviews in return for cash look at the panic and uproar that erupted over the announcement of peeple  the yelp for people app an attempt to bootstrap a version of scs using purely user generated content at this point it almost doesnt matter if the proposed clearinghouse for peoples ratings of other people they know comes out or not the idea is simple enough and the reasons its frightening are obvious enough that it was already thoroughly mocked in the meow meow beanz episode of community  and yet that didnt stop nicole mccullough and julia cordray from moving ahead with peeple even if peeples founders bow to public pressure and scrap the project or try to radically rework it to be purely  positive  nothing stops the next set of founders from creating a more neutral or outright malicious version of peeple to feed our dark appetite for saying nasty things about each other behind each others backs its the same logic after all behind apps like yik yak or the subculture around comment sections and chans no matter how many times we write think pieces exhorting each other to pay no attention to the voice of the anonymous mob we still find ourselves jerked around by it human nature is to be deeply invested in knowing what people in general think in getting some reified abstract consensus of the population as a whole as a neat tidy number we feel like were validated if we get to vote on what we as a whole think and we treat that consensus as more valid than any individual opinion no matter how flawed that concept may be our technology is happy to enable this obsession aggregating and averaging and quantifying to our hearts content turning our collective opinion of restaurants and films and consumer products into tidy integers cory doctorow tech prophet of our times predicted all this back in 2003 with his novel down and out in the magic kingdom that introduced the concept of  whuffie doctorow imagined a post scarcity world where everyone was guaranteed basic food and shelter rather than ownership of material goods economic life revolved entirely around a reputation currency called whuffie which like favs on twitter or likes on facebook or stars on yelp represented nothing but what other people thought of you the whuffie system promised to deliver us from the arbitrariness of who gets rich and who gets poor in the real money economy and instead focus on what really mattered which was your social standing among your peers it sounded appealing enough to some people that at techcrunch 50 in 2009 the whuffie bank nonprofit was founded to try to make reputation currency into a reality now in 2015 the whuffie bank is dead and every attempt to implement something like whuffieklout peeple scsfeels less like a dream and more like a nightmare doctorow admits that he got the term whuffie from local slang at his high school for teenage  brownie points anyone whos been in high school knows that the way the popularity game works is capricious and often vicious that the process of scoring points is not in any sense meritocratic and can easily be gamed by those unscrupulous and skilled enough to do so and that if anything a popularity economy is one where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer far more reliably than even the real money economy one of my favorite responses to doctorows whuffie is ben rosenbaums 2010 short story  the guy who worked for money  positing that in the reputation economy of the future there will be some of us who long for the good old days of good old fashioned alienated labor and trading toil for coin because for some of us that might be less stressful and scary than spending all our time worrying what everyone thinks of us the guy who works for money in rosenbaums story does so by fleeing the ubiquitous reputation web in europe for the un networked hinterland of china and the stans in the real world of 2015 china is embracing the reputation based web faster than europe and  facebook zero  is working overtime to get the social web embedded everywhere else before long there may be nowhere left to flee sarah jeongs the internet of garbage argues that despite all the appealing metaphors about size and space and bigness we use about the internetthe electronic frontier and so onthe internets real effect has been to make our world smaller the time when you could sell your house and drive to another state to start a new life with new friends and a new reputation is over now wherever you go and whatever you do your reputation is what comes up on the first page of google when someone looks up your name now we all live in the same small town or high school or prison depending on your perspective im high profile enough that ive had the experience of people coordinating to broadcast smears about me and push them up my google search results i havent gotten it nearly as badly as other people some of whom have seen their entire careers implode over essentially nothing because they pissed off the wrong dedicated hate mob but even thats not really what concerns me when quasi famous people get slimed by other quasi famous people theres at least an argument to be had specific points to contest evidence to grapple with what about when our existing paranoia over how one late payment affects our credit spills over into paranoia over how one errant tweet or photo or comment might give our whuffie a hit what about when you dont even have a list of google search results to pore over just an opaque number that jumps upward or downward as unpredictably as the stock market every day we take another step toward that future the whole world of social networking and the drive to monetize social networking by pulling useful data out of it is inexorably pulling us toward that future and every step we take in the other directionthe eus  right to be forgotten  one city trying to limit the overuse of credit scores in decision making our transient moment of outrage over peepleseems laughably weak in comparison the eu is stepping up their dissent against the us led ideal that more access to everyones data will always make for a better world critics of the eus increasingly restrictive privacy policies worry that it will split the internet into pieces that it will throw a roadblock the wonderfully economically productive process of shrinking the world into a global village perhaps we tech leaders in the united states need to think about the fact that in opposing such measures were standing against our fellow first world democracies and standing with the authoritarian bogeyman of chinas one party state its easy to get called a luddite these days for advocating any proposal to limit the growth of the social web but even if there is no stopping or even slowing this train were on its at least worth thinking about the downsides of the destination even if we have to imagine it happening in communist china before we get it featured image paolo trabbatoni  flickr under a cc by 20 license 
eric schmidt talks alphabet encryption european policy when alphabet was formed eric schmidt its chairman and one of the five people who technically constitute googles new holding company was on vacation learning to fly i wake up and im the chairman of alphabet schmidt said on tuesday at the virtuous circle conference in menlo park calif we sort of announced it without actually knowing which companies it would be so were still working the details the talk during a summit on tech and policy convened by the internet association trade group was closed door but recode obtained a recording schmidt the long time google chairman and former ceo spoke on a number of policy topics including encryption bandwidth regulation googles beleaguered right to be forgotten saga in europe and the sharing economy he said he was very worried about recent data privacy proposals in europe such as its safe harbor ruling last week  that assign digital regulation to individual nations  creating per country internets in schmidts words if that occurs he said we would lose one of the greatest achievements of humanity he was not asked about the antitrust cases google has faced and currently faces nor did he bring them up none of schmidts comments on policy were new his statements on alphabet reiterated what little the company has said but he did voice whats been unsaid yet largely assumed about the conglomerate  that there may be many more subsidiaries to come how many after 26 were going to probably transcendental numbers like  schmidt said to laughs you think im kidding he went on ive been meeting with the current ceos of the alphabet companies and the proposed ones so youll see a lot coming schmidt did not divulge what those would be he did however lavish praise on a potential company googles self driving car initiative though it has a ceo its still tucked inside google x and he talked up the business of an existing one when asked what internet companies beyond alphabet he finds exciting schmidt cited the startup financed by alphabet company google ventures uber 
google accidentally reveals data on right to be forgotten requests less than 5 of nearly 220000 individual requests made to google to selectively remove links to online information concern criminals politicians and high profile public figures the guardian has learned with more than 95 of requests coming from everyday members of the public the data covers more than three quarters of all requests to date previously more emphasis has been placed on selective information concerning more sensational examples of so called right to be forgotten requests released by google and reported by some of the media  which have largely ignored the majority of requests made by citizens concerned with protecting their personal privacy these include a woman whose name appeared in prominent news articles after her husband died another seeking removal of her address and an individual infected with hiv a decade ago the underlying source code has since been updated to remove these details this data covers the majority of requests received by google which have now exceeded 280000 since the company first started to process requests in may 2014 as a result of a ruling by the european court of justice graphic of 218320 requests to remove links between 29 may 2014 and 23 march 2015 101461 46 have been successfully delisted on individual name searches of these 99569 involve private or personal information only 1892 requests  less than 1 of the overall total  were successful for the four remaining issue types identified within googles source code serious crime 728 requests public figure 454 political 534 or child protection 176  presumably because they concern victims incidental witnesses spent convictions or the private lives of public persons by contrast for each of the other categories around one in five have actually been delisted the numbers fall evenly between crime public figures political and child protection around two thirds of these requests are refused in many countries including france germany the netherlands austria portugal and cyprus 98 of requests concern private information in only three countries did proportions of private information fall below 90 italy 85 romania 87 and hungary 88 in the remaining most populous countries the uk and spain the proportion is 95 it is not clear whether requests have been made by those who are the main subject of web links or by a third party a link categorised as serious crime for example may involve a request from a victim or witness rather than the perpetrator figure 2 between countries there is variation in the rate of compliance for example more than half the private information requests through france and germany have been successfully delisted yet this comes closer to a third in the uk and italy we discontinued that test in march because the data was not reliable enough for publication we are however currently working on ways to improve our transparency reporting as such it is becoming almost like a court or government but without the fundamental checks on its power because we know so little about the cases google can push the discussion about the right to be forgotten in a particular direction  overdramatise or play it down he notes that the governing legal framework is in part responsible because it allows data controllers such as google to be in charge of the delisting process related googles action on revenge porn opens the door on right to be forgotten in us but it clearly needs to provide more granular information dr paul bernal lecturer in technology and media law at the uea school of law argues that the data reveals that the right to be forgotten seems to be a legitimate piece of law it seems there is a need for this  and people go for it for genuine reasons the totals used for calculation are based on the sum of the individual categories presented in googles source code not the totals visualised on the front page of the archived data set for 23 march 2015 which differ slightly 
google must expand privacy delistings says french watchdog the french data protection watchdog has ordered google to widen its implementation of the so called european  right to be forgotten  so that links are also delisted from all google domains including googlecom not just as is currently the case from thefr french subdomain quick backgrounder here the rtbf refers to a legal ruling by europes top court last year it identified search engines as data controllers and required they process requests from private individuals wanting outdated inaccurate or irrelevant information delisted from a search result for their name google which is by far and away the dominant search engine in europe started processing these requests last summer however the way google implemented the courts ruling has created a trivial workaround because it only delists links from european sub domains such asfr andcouk not from googlecom last november european regulators urged that link delisting should take place on thecom domain too google has ignored that guidance thus far but the screw looks to be tightening if national regulators step up enforcement efforts today the french cnil said it has put google on notice to expand delisting requests to all its domains includingcom it has given google 15 days to comply with its request if google does not comply it says it will initiate sanction proceedings if google inc does not comply with the formal notice within the fifteen days the president will be in position to nominate a rapporteur to draft a report recommending to the cnil select committee the committee in charge of imposing sanctions in case of violation of the french data protection law to impose a sanction to the company the cnil said today the cnil also notes it has received hundreds of complaints from individuals whose requests for delisting have not been granted by google after assessing these complaints it says it has requested google carry out the delisting of several results and despite specifying the delisting should be effective on whole search engine irrespective of the extension used the cnil notes that where google has granted appealed delisting requests it has only done so on european sub domains in a statement provided to techcrunch regarding the cnils order a google spokesperson said weve been working hard to strike the right balance in implementing the european courts ruling co operating closely with data protection authorities the ruling focused on services directed to european users and thats the approach we are taking in complying with it  google failed to respond directly when asked whether it will be expanding delisting tocom in accordance with the cnils order the company has previously argued that applying delisting tocom is unnecessary because only a very small percentage of european traffic goes tocom another option thats not apparently on the table at this point but which might offer a third way between two clearly clashing positions would be to offer global link delisting on a case by case basis as posited in a recent research paper covered by slate  rather than having blanket requirements that search engines always delist globally or a blanket refusal from search engines to offer anything other than partial and thus trivially circumvented delisting  which is the current impasse the rtbf ruling has always been about striking a balance between any public right to know information and a private individuals right to privacy and given the inevitable variance involved in individual delisting requests then any general solutions  be it blanket requirements or blanket refusals  are always going to feel a little ill fitting featured image jon russell  flickr under a cc by nd 20 license 
should delisting be global or local photo by francois lenoirreuters it might be recognized for what it is a critical test of our commitment to giving individuals some small degree of control over personal data the debate has fallen easily into overdrawn grand narratives  between  disruptive  innovative tech companies and  protectionist  regulators between the informational interests of the global public and easily trivialized private individuals between us openness and european restraint it derives from the standoff between european data regulators who represent the european commission and each state in the 28 member eu bloc and google the highest profile company involved google has resisted implementing delisting requests only on european country code extensions googlefr  googlede  googlecouk  and so on a new report by a google appointed advisory panel has by majority with an important dissent from long time german justice minister sabine leutheusser schnarrenberger backed googles approach so the tension is really between enforcement that is effective global and potentially overreaching and enforcement that is geographically localized through the power of default  but simple to circumvent by switching to googlecom or any non european domain part of the reason the regulators and google are split is because they are seeking a general solution this may be both undesirable and unnecessary given the grab bag of interests that motivate delisting and the balances involved at the other end of the spectrum there are a small number of instances that involve multiple parties and real potential conflicts between privacy speech and access to information if delisting is determined on a case by case basis surely the remedy can be too one approach to deciding whether to delist globally or locally is detailed in a new paper by belgian based researchers brendan van alsenoy and marieke koekkoek they emphasize that delisting is already contingent on personal data not being in the public interest the spanish victor of the european court ruling whose data concerned a spanish auction published in a spanish newspaper is a good example by contrast information that has international reach and potential interest or which strongly engages another countrys free speech protections such as a canadian authored article involving a european citizen published in a us news outlet may be better dealt with by only delisting results on that citizens name in europe successfully delisted from google search results on subjects name delisting rejected maintained in google search results on subjects name a victim of physical assault asked for results describing the assault to be removed for queries against her name 1 request by a pedophile who wanted links to articles about his conviction removed 13 a request to remove results detailing a patients medical history 1 elected politician requesting removal of links to news articles about a political scandal he was associated with 1 a request by someone incidentally mentioned in a story a news report but not the actual subject of the reporting 1 multiple requests from a single individual who asked to remove

the articles were recent and deliberately made public by the author 2 the name on the membership list of a far right party of someone who no longer holds such views 3 request by a doctor objecting to patient reviews 3 reports of a violent crime committed by someone later acquitted because of mental disability more than 222000 citizens based in europe have made delisting requests and yet the debate focuses on a handful of cases in the press angst over the extraterritorial question is a symptom of incomplete knowledge it precludes engagement the discovery of common ground and the evolution of predictable and consistent approaches to different categories of cases and conflicts in cases where different legal regimes may reasonably differ on the balance of interests for and against delisting an intermediate alternative not yet seriously considered by the opposed parties is location based  rather than domain based delisting this is a stronger form of geo filtering and is better targeted and harder though not impossible to circumvent it has found particular favor with french courts seeking to effectively remedy defamation blasphemy and privacy cases while domain based delisting is more favored in european antitrust proceedings where reduction of market dominance is the primary objective for as long as physical location rather than virtual domain is the basis for tailoring results and advertisements location based delisting seems to be a more credible basis for search engines to give full effect to european law within the framework of their responsibilities powers and capabilities while also avoiding some of the perceived challenges of global delisting of course proxies virtual private networks and pseudonymity tools can all evade location based delisting but this is more complex than a one click switch to an alternative domain and alternative content it furthers the objective of the right to delist which is to practically obscure and prevent further proliferation of the offending material rather than to remove it at source perhaps it is a good direction in any event because the more that citizens experiment with variegated tools the more complex and costly it becomes to collect and mine data at scale and government and corporate surveillance will return to its proper homeland intelligence on the other hand location based delisting is still a less than ideal solution in all cases since it is patchy and vulnerableand the evasion tools favor the well informed or wealthy these measures can serve a public interest but without careful safeguards on mitigating republishing they risk undermining the private rights of individuals too removal must be treated with appropriate sensitivity or it undermines the entire enterprise clearly if national or regional laws are enforced worldwide  then web users will have access to less digital content in mathematical terms from 62 requests in 2008 to 345 million in 2014 google has devised a very substantial apparatus for dealing with copyright takedown requests and for this it applies us law on a worldwide basis at a 97 percent acceptance rate why has google conceded to implementing copyright requests at a level exceeding privacy requests by three orders of magnitude the deeper truth is that copyright enforcement doesnt threaten the geoeconomic geopolitical order in the same way that giving users control over personal data doesempowering citizens in other wordsand that is something that deserves much deeper reflection and civic and political engagement than weve seen to date

web freedom is seen to be growing as a global issue in 2015 san francisco  government censorship of the internet is a cat and mouse game and despite more aggressive tactics in recent months the cats have been largely frustrated while the mice wriggle away but this year the challenges for silicon valley will mount with russia and turkey in particular trying to tighten controls on foreign based internet companies major american companies like facebook twitter and google are increasingly being put in the tricky position of figuring out which laws and orders to comply with around the world  and which to ignore or contest on wednesday russias president vladimir v putin signed the latest version of a personal data law that will require companies to store data about russian users on computers inside the country where it will be easier for the government to get access to it with few companies expected to comply with the law which goes into effect sept 1 a confrontation may well erupt the clumsiness of current censorship efforts was apparent in mid december when russias internet regulator demanded that facebook remove a page that was promoting an anti government rally after facebook blocked the page for its 10 million or so russian users dozens of copycat pages popped up and the word spread on other social networks like twitter that created even more publicity for the planned jan 15 event intended to protest the sentencing of aleksei a navalny a leading opposition figure anton nosik a prominent russian blogger whose work has been censored by regulators said it was absurd for a government to think it could easily stamp out an article or video when it can be copied or found elsewhere with a few clicks the reader wants to see what he was prevented from seeing mr nosik said in an interview all that blocking doesnt work instead that prompted the government to switch tactics moving mr navalnys sentencing to dec 30 with little notice in an attempt to diminish protests the turkish government faced similar embarrassment when it tried to stop the dissemination of leaked documents and audio recordings on twitter in march the administration of recep tayyip erdogan who was then prime minister and is now president ordered the shutdown of twitter within turkey after the company refused to block the posts which implicated government officials in a corruption investigation not only did the government lose a court fight on the issue but while twitter was blocked legions of turkish users taught one another technical tricks to evade the ban even spray painting the instructions on the walls of buildings we all became hackers asli tunc a professor of communication at istanbul bilgi university said in a phone interview and we all got on twitter despite such victories for free speech advocates governments around the world are stepping up their efforts to control the internet escalating the confrontation the trendlines are consistent colin crowell twitters global vice president of public policy said in a phone interview there are more and more requests for removal of information pakistan for example bombarded facebook with nearly 1800 requests to take down content in the first half of 2014 according to the companys most recent transparency report googles youtube video service has long been blocked there and the government briefly succeeding in getting twitter to block certain blasphemous or unethical tweets last year until the company re examined pakistani law and determined the requests didnt meet legal requirements its not just autocratic regimes that are pressing for limits on free speech in the european union a court ruling last year established a right to be forgotten allowing residents to ask search engines like google to remove links to negative material about them now privacy regulators want google to also delete the links from search results on the non european versions of its service because anyone in europe can easily get access to the alternate sites free speech activists view facebook the worlds largest social network with 135 billion monthly users as the company most inclined to work with governments and do whatever is necessary to keep its service up and running last spring while twitter was blocked in turkey and youtube was shut down facebook removed contested content and continued to operate it has a dedicated team of outside lawyers who field censorship requests from the turkish government and then recommend to corporate officials whether content should be blocked facebook can be quite important to the people who use it so we try to make sure it remains accessible a company spokesman said we aggressively push back on unlawful or overly broad government requests twitter which has about 284 million monthly users styles itself as the worlds town square and a global champion of free speech conforming to the letter of censorship laws while winking at workaround strategies like users changing the location listed on their profile to evade specific blocks that apply in a particular country for turkeys opposition movement professor tunc said twitter basically created an opening a refreshing alternative especially during the protests and they know that they act like a defender of freedom as the biggest player google whose youtube service seems to draw the particular ire of foreign governments has been forced into fights on many fronts it is still viewed by many as a hero for its decision to pull out of china in 2010 rather than continue to censor search results there the company explained its philosophy at that time  we have a bias in favor of peoples right to free expression we are driven by a belief that more information means more choice more freedom and ultimately more power for the individual while china remains a thorn in the side of most western internet companies  facebook and twitter are basically blocked there  russia is the current flash point in the censorship wars over the summer the russian government began demanding that anyone with at least 3000 daily visitors follow rules similar to those applying to a media company and face content restrictions so far twitter and facebook are simply passing those requests along to their users without making sure anyone complies many do not but so far the russian government has not pressed the issue but the pressure may intensify later this year starting sept 1 foreign technology companies are supposed to store data about russian users on computers located in russia and make a software key available to the government that could be used to unscramble and monitor private internet communications that would give the government leverage in showdowns with tech companies since it could simply raid the facility or arrest local employees most western technology companies have no data centers in russia and no plans to change that our data centers are all in the united states said mr crowell of twitter its unlikely that our first data center outside the united states will be in russia google whose search engine is the no 2 player in russia after the local yandex service has gone further announcing recently that it will close its engineering offices in russia although the company said it had been consolidating such offices globally one factor in the closure is the risk of a raid by russian authorities if whats going to happen is that russians will show up and stick an ak 47 in an engineers nostril google is going to make sure that no one in russia has a google engineering logon said ross j anderson a professor of security engineering at cambridge university in britain who studies privacy and censorship issues and did some work for google in the past a google spokesman declined to comment on its russia strategy saying only we are deeply committed to our russian users and customers and we have a dedicated team in russia working to support them twitter and facebook have more room to maneuver with far fewer users in russia and virtually no advertising there they can resist the governments demands with fewer repercussions robert shlegel a member of the russian parliament active in shaping the kremlins internet policies said in a phone interview that the russian regulations were in many ways a response to the revelations of the former american intelligence contractor edward j snowden about american government spying through silicon valley companies this problem was created by the united states mr shlegel said mr snowden lives in russia which granted him residency as the united states government sought to arrest him for his leaks russias first preference mr shlegel said is to persuade other nations to form a common international set of rules for social networking sites and crowdsourced news clarifying when countries could block pages to comply with national laws he said that russian authorities had no intention of blocking american internet companies for failing to follow the data storage law what we need to do is have a dialogue he said and given western sanctions and the collapse in the rubles value russia needs foreign business support at least in part to prevent its online economy from grinding to a halt if strictly enforced the personal data law for example would close most internet hotel and airline bookings sending russians to stand in line at travel agencies instead mr nosik the russian blogger said that the countrys internet regulator roskomnadzor was unlikely to ban american companies like facebook if only for fear that millions of russians who suddenly lost access to years of photographs family memories love letters and contacts with friends would blame the kremlin only mr putin could decide to cut off access he said the moment putin wants it done it will be done within minutes and no law will be required mr nosik said on the other hand so long as putin doesnt give the command to block them they will not be blocked 
a bicyclist rides by a sign at the google headquarters europes privacy regulators want the right to be forgotten to go global in a new set of guidelines agreed wednesday in brussels the body representing the eus 28 national privacy regulators said that search engines should apply the blocs new right to be forgotten to all of their websites  in particularcom websites like googlecom which google inc had excluded from the new rule the guidelines escalate a disagreement between regulators and the search giant over how to implement a may decision by europes top court which determined that individuals in europe have an online right to be forgotten that applies to internet search engines under the new rule people can demand that google and other engines remove links to pages that come up when one searches for their names at issue is how broadly google googl 032 must apply the new rule privacy advocates allege that google has been undermining the new right by limiting its application while free speech advocates say the rule is a gateway to internet censorship that will whitewash the web while google moved quickly to apply the ruling over the summer it has only applied it to european domains like googlefr or googlecouk but not on googlecom even when accessed in europe that can make it easier to find results that have been removed by comparing the websites 
fighting for the right to be forgotten on the web every time gary katcher sees the article he feels that his reputation is being dragged through the mud again its an article from forbes dated jan 13 2012 touching on a lawsuit between him and an ex partner in his investment firm over a nasty business divorce the article was accurate reporting fairly on the claims of wrongdoing exchanged between the former partners during four years of litigation it eventually was settled in katchers favor but the magazine never ran a follow up now if you type gary katchers name into google the first item that pops up is the article with all its murky innuendo this article unfairly casts a shadow on my reputation because it is out of date katcher 57 told me last week ultimately the record clearly shows that i did nothing wrong i have always acted with the utmost integrity and ethical behavior in a perfectly fair world the 2012 article would long ago have vanished instead it lives eternally on the internet under us law katcher has no way to force the deletion of a link to the story although all the evidence vindicated mr katcher says his washington lawyer howard schiffman theres no legal remedy to get the truth into the public domain in europe however katcher might have a shot at forcing google to delete the piece from its search results last may the european court of justice upheld and strengthened the right to be forgotten  the right of individuals to ask that personal information be deleted because its outdated irrelevant incomplete or no longer necessary to achieve its original purpose in the us privacy experts are taking a new look at whether a right to be forgotten law aimed at internet search engines can coexist with the constitutional protections of freedom of speech and the press some see the answer in a combination of property and privacy rights  the concept that people have the right to control their private facts held by commercial entities and that they dont expect to be widely available says marc rotenberg president of the electronic privacy information center fears about a european style rulings impact on free speech and the press are probably overwrought the case arose in 2010 after a spanish lawyer discovered that a google search turned up newspaper reports more than a decade old about a property foreclosure that he had resolved years earlier he asked that the reports be removed from the newspapers website and the links be expunged from googles search the court ordered the google links taken down but allowed the newspaper reports to remain online as the european commission explained the right to be forgotten is not absolute but must be balanced on a case by case basis against freedom of expression and the public interest its not about making prominent people less prominent or making criminals less criminal google says it has received about 163000 removal requests approving 417 it granted a crime victims request to remove links to crime reports appearing in searches for her name it turned down requests from accused perpetrators for removal of reports of crimes concerns about technologys incursion into personal space are nothing new the future supreme court justice louis d brandeis wrote of  the right to be let alone in 1890 when he made a very modern observation about how mechanical devices threaten to make good the prediction that what is whispered in the closet shall be proclaimed from the house tops for a century after that the spread of personal information was limited by the security of obscurity years ago people searching for your listed home phone would have to know where you lived in order to consult your local phone book today a simple search from anywhere on earth can turn up your number and address notwithstanding free speech guarantees limits on the dissemination of even public information are widespread in the us most states allow juvenile criminal records to be sealed or expunged information about gun permits which was once easily available in many states is now closed or available only through physical searches at local law enforcement or court offices californias pioneering eraser law allows minors to demand that some websites remove posts theyve made public themselves copyright owners can force web services to take down videos and other material that infringe their rights on the whole however the right to be forgotten in the us belongs to the rich and powerful when nude photographs of well known actresses made it onto the web the stars managed to get them taken down by major websites in short order when the orlando sentinel and other publications sought autopsy photos and other public records related to the 2001 crash death of nascar driver dale earnhardt the release was barred by an act of the florida legislature there was no such luck for the orange county family of nikki catsouras photos of whose grisly 2006 fatal car crash proliferated over the internet after their unauthorized release by two california highway patrol employees because the family didnt own the photos its efforts to get links to them removed from search engines and websites were unavailing even the chp shut the door on us says nikkis mother lesli its difficult when youre just a housewife in a living room trying to figure things out the catsouras family settled its lawsuit against the chp for 237 million in 2012 but the photos havent entirely disappeared from the web options for an american right to be forgotten are beginning to emerge jonathan zittrain co founder of harvards berkman center for internet and society says focusing on search engines allows for the information itself to remain public with a question of how to narrow the indexing of it he also praised an experiment launched by google years ago allowing people quoted or mentioned in a news article to append a clarifying comment next to the article on the google news service the function doesnt appear to be available any longer can google and other search companies make the fine distinctions required by the european courts case by case balancing test there will be obvious candidates for removal such as crime stories that place innocent people in a false light and obvious absurdities such as the recent request from a professional musician that the washington post remove an old unfavorable review im willing to acknowledge its not always easy to draw the line rotenberg says there will be hard cases but theyll exist as an exception michael hiltziks column appears sundays and

times articles removed from google results in europe google has notified the new york times in the last month that links to five articles have been removed from some search results on european versions of its search engine to comply with europes right to be forgotten the notifications offer vivid examples of the issues involved in europes decision to allow individuals some measure of control over what appears online about themselves of the five articles that google informed the times about three are intensely personal  two wedding announcements from years ago and a brief paid death notice from 2001 presumably the people involved had privacy reasons for asking for the material to be hidden the other two times articles are less about personal details than about reputation and it is this concern  even if the facts are fairly reported  that represents a big difference between the way europe and the united states regulate or do not regulate how information is presented online unlike in the united states where freedom of expression is a fundamental right that supersedes other interests europe views an individuals privacy and freedom of expression as almost equal rights as a matter of policy google does not reveal who asked for the material to be shielded or even what search terms will cause the articles to disappear from results a little online research  with the help of search engines  showed that each article had a person with a connection to europe google and privacy lawyers are at loggerheads over whether anyone in the world can ask that material be hidden from european search engines or only people in europe one times article that is being shielded from certain searches in europe is a report from 2002 about a decision by a united states court to close three websites that the federal government accused of selling an estimated 1 million worth of unusable web addresses the complaint named three british companies tld network quantum management and tbs industries as well as two men who it said controlled the companies thomas goolnik and edward harris goolnik of london the case was later settled thomas goolnik did not respond to messages left via social networking sites since may when the european high court made its initial decision on the right to be forgotten google has received roughly 140000 privacy requests connected to more than 500000 links according to the companys top lawyer so far the search giant has approved around half of the requests the bulk do not involve news websites this summer google told several european media outlets including the bbc and the guardian that links to some of their online articles had been removed from its european search results yet in a bizarre twist the company later reinstated some of the links to the guardians articles after that paper challenged googles decision in the last of the times articles a feature about a 1998 production of villa villa by the ensemble called de la guarda it was much harder to divine the objection not a review the article explored how the antic acrobatic show was managing to get a generation raised on mtv interested in seeing live theater a version of this article appears in print on october 4 2014 on page a3 of the new york edition with the headline times articles removed from google results in europe 
death drones and driverless cars how google wants to control our lives if you want to understand the future of humanity  where were headed wholl be in charge and exactly how worried you should be about that  you could do worse than begin with two unremarkable buildings on opposite coasts of the us the more famous one half a mile from googles main campus in mountain view california is home to google x  the search giants purportedly secret research lab its not really very secret from breathless reports in the technology press we know its where googles co founder sergey brin  oversees the development of self driving cars tiny drones that can deliver packages by hovering high above the ground and winching them down on fishing line helium balloons to beam 3g internet access to remote parts of the world unmanned flying turbines to collect wind energy at high altitudes and google glass  the head mounted web connected video enabled computer perfect for alienating friends and strangers alike the other building at 25 massachusetts avenue in washington dc gets less attention since july it has been home to googles expanding political lobbying activities  a staff of 110 now works there under susan molinari a former republican congresswoman for new york ten years ago  the year it went public  google spent a mere 180000 on lobbying as of this august according to the wall street journal  it had spent 93m in 2014 alone making it the second biggest spender among private companies ahead of defence contractors such as lockheed martin and outdone only by dow chemical facebook and microsoft both spent significantly less washington politicians are well accustomed to being treated to steak dinners by lobbyists and receiving campaign contributions from those they represent google gave 11m to national us political candidates in the first half of this year but googles lobbying reaches much further if you are say an illinois lawmaker pondering a bill to stop people wearing glass while theyre driving you may find google lobbyists reaching out for discussion if youre in a position to influence legislation on driverless cars you may find yourself being taken for a spin in one there are google policy teams in brussels in berlin site of many battles with the german government over privacy and in many other cities including london where the team is headed by sarah hunter  a former senior adviser to tony blair the google inc office in washington dc home to googles expanding political lobbying activities this level of political activity is unusual for a technology company what in the broadest sense is google up to even more broadly what is google these days looked at one way its just a massively successful advertising company 90 of its revenue  or about 52bn in 2013 comes from ads like the ones that pop up when you search no wonder a cynic might say that google wants people to be permitted to wear glass while they drive it wants people never to leave the internet at all but then there are the self driving cars and the drones theres baseline study  a project to collect blood saliva and urine from hundreds of anonymous volunteers to try to predict the likelihood of heart attacks and other life threatening conditions and calico  a biotech subsidiary that aims  in the words of time magazine anyway  to solve death among the more than 160 companies that google has acquired since 2001  recently at an average of more than one a week  are makers of robot arms and robot wheels thermostats and smoke detectors a satellite imaging company that has launched two private satellites from russia and kazakhstan and zagat  the restaurant review business are these all just the hobbies of astonishingly rich men whod like to find a way not to die and a good place for dinner or is there a masterplan what does google want you have to read between the lines of how google works  a new book by the companys executive director eric schmidt and its head of product jonathan rosenberg to catch a hint of an answer to questions like that mainly the book is a googleish version of a self help manual for managers  full of upbeat west coast business advice make big bets instead of small ones so youll feel forced to succeed treat your career like youre surfing launch things before theyre ready so you can improve them using customer feedback theres a photo of schmidt dancing with the korean rapper psy and jokey anecdotes about larry page the socially inept genius who started the whole thing but theres also a refreshingly icy honesty the authors freely concede that googles offices feature free food pool tables and napping pods in order to keep workers there as much as possible they should be overworked in a good way its products are free and some of its code and company data shared more openly than elsewhere because rapid growth is the best path to a bigger audience for ads even dont be evil googles famous motto  is not entirely what it seems schmidt and rosenberg write it was always less about some crusade to do good than about providing employees with the most minimal possible moral framework to free them to focus on creating new products their candour has its limits they steer clear of discussing googles role in the surveillance activities revealed by edward snowden or of allegations of tax avoidance overall the book reinforces the general impression you get the more you probe googles activities its not that it began as an internet search engine then metamorphosed into something no one could have foreseen on the contrary page and brin were clear from the outset their mission was to organise the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful the crucial thing about that sentence is that theres no reference to the internet in some sense every person every object every thought in every brain everything anyone ever does is information page and brin told us what google was up to we just didnt take them literally enough google co founders sergey brin left and larry page were clear from the start  their mission was to organise the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful photograph paul sakumaassociated press the way page tells it in a foreword to how google works it began with a dream an actual dream in bed one night aged 22 while a graduate student at stanford university the michigan born page had a vision what if you could download the whole web then strip away everything but the links youd be left with the hidden structure of cyberspace how everything connects to everything else and which pages are linked to the most a useful indicator of their importance and reliability that insight became pagerank  the algorithm behind google search a few years later when the company was still in its infancy the other part of the puzzle clicked into place one day in 1999 page and rosenberg were crossing a car park when larry mentioned almost in passing that there had to be a way eventually to monetise search after all larry reasoned when someone did a search they were telling google exactly what they were interested in organise the worlds information and you would create at the same time both the most useful service on the internet and the best targeted most blisteringly efficient delivery system for ads you could view everything google does today as representing the extension of these principles beyond web pages to the rest of the world and thanks to google sky and google moon  beyond the world too this is fairly obvious in the case of google maps google earth or the street view image database they all help make google a search engine for the offline world for a subtler example take those drones according to a report in the atlantic  google staff in rural australia have been testing miniature tail sitter aircraft which take off as helicopters then rotate to become planes upon reaching its destination the tail sitter sends its package hurtling downwards at 10 metres per second until just before it reaches the ground when an egg shaped device at the end of the fishing line detects the change in altitude and slows it down the google team dont yet have an answer for what happens if the package hits power cables but if you try to steal a drone by tugging on the wire a razor blade in the aircrafts body will slice it off enabling it to cut and run the drones are all part of the plan what excited us from the beginning astro teller of google x told the atlantic  is that if the right thing could find anybody just in the right moment they need it the world might be a radically better place a search engine for the physical world is of limited use if it only serves up online photos of whatever youre looking for a google drone network could bring you the thing itself almost as instantaneously as the search box delivers electronic results or if more practical google could deliver you to it by means of a self driving car a project wing drone vehicle makes a delivery its been clear for some time that google sees nothing as being beyond its domain says siva vaidhyanathan  a cultural historian at the university of virginia and author of the 2011 book the googlization of everything everything is subject to being organised or distilled or analysed assessed and presented by googles algorithms it became the operating system of the web then of our mobile devices now it would like to be the operating system of your eyeglasses and your automobile it has a prediction it wants to fulfil that data will flow through everything your re frigerator your clothing every aspect of human interaction and if everythings quantifiable and traceable google wants to be the company that monetises that its an immodest vision  but nobody every accused google of modesty the beauty of this strategy commercially speaking is that whatever serves to connect people to what they want also serves to educate googles giant artificial brain about what they want enriching the data stream on which advertisings value depends the search box learns what youre looking for location enabled phones running googles android operating system learns that too along with where you are how fast youre moving or whether you seem to be stuck in traffic gmail learns what youre communicating about web connected thermostats might guess when youre on holiday glass could come to know precisely what youre looking at self driving cars could rapidly build a detailed picture of users daily rhythms devices to collect health related data such as blood pressure or cholesterol levels could help target ads for anything from medical services to health products or seemingly unrelated things maybe people with high cholesterol spend more on shoes or science fiction novels the patterns revealed in data dont need to make sense to humans sometimes i think about googles business model as the best on the face of the earth since rockefeller and oil says fred vogelstein  a contributing editor to wired magazine and author of dogfight how apple and google went to war and started a revolution the more people use the internet the more money google makes and if you think about it in that simple way it gives google licence to do pretty much anything this also explains why google lobbyists end up to many onlookers on the good side of the net neutrality debate but the bad side of say the copyright debate or the distracted driving debate really theyre on the more internet more data collection side of every debate and the anti facebook side by enticing us to spend our online lives within its walls facebook poses a huge threat to googles data collection efforts sit back and relax google self driving cars photograph eric risbergassociated press what do human beings do every day asks vogelstein they look for stuff find stuff or use stuff they dont have to look for because they already found it google built the best search and discover machine in the digital world doesnt it make sense to try to leverage that into the physical world and yet as many have observed all this seamless searching and finding comes at a cost the usual way of putting it is that its privacy that gets compromised the data google collects can only be properly exploited if its all tied to a single user identity for each real world human that explains googles hostility to pseudonyms and multiple identities  and its deeply unpopular attempt  now abandoned to force users of its google social network to use their real names vaidhyanathan puts it slightly differently the biggest threat posed by a data saturated future he argues is to human dignity and diversity that includes the right to withhold certain information from certain people or institutions  and also the freedom to build your life around values that arent googles efficiency and transparency become the paramount values superseding all other values to google theres only one way to be and thats perfectly transparent and maximally efficient in boiling everything down to digital signals we lose the colour and flavour and turmoil of competing values so the challenge is to politicise digital culture to understand that we cant just sit back and let these boys play with so many important things with impunity the worst option here is the one where we assume that whats good for google is good for the world that may be true more than half the time but its not true enough to bet the future on to see how far weve already gone in this direction he says consider the controversy over the recent european court judgment on the  right to be forgotten  requiring google to remove some search results the ruling was unclear impractical and probably self defeating but googles boosters in the media didnt just object on those grounds they erupted in incredulous fury that anyone might assert a right not to have their lives wholly transparent to google in the first place and then theres the controversy over whether google is using its position of dominance fairly earlier this month a group of european publishers ran newspaper advertisements accusing the firm of favouring its own sites in search results denying the charges schmidt responded  we built google for users not websites it has also been accused of acting as a de facto censor by removing from its advertising network sites it deems offensive google glass you may never have to leave the internet at all whether youre alarmed or excited by the possibility of a fully googleised world though  and wouldnt most of us admit to a little of both  theres something else to consider can the internet economy really survive forever on advertising alone googles average cost per click  reflecting the amount it can charge advertisers for a single click on one of their advertisements  has generally been falling since 2011 as advertising colonises the web it seems to be getting less and less effective studies suggest that younger adults are less influenced by it than older ones the first online banner ad published in 1994 was clicked by an astonishing 78 of the people who saw it these days when people see an ad what proportion of them click on facebook its one 20th of 1 in a playful paper published last year  from which these statistics are drawn two researchers tim hwang and adi kamdar  floated the possibility of peak advertising  a point at which advertising might reach its maximum effectiveness and then begin gradually to die if that really happened they argue it would initially strengthen the hand of google only huge firms would retain big enough distribution networks and sufficiently massive datasets to make advertising pay at all whether advertising thrives or falters then googles position as the proprietor of the maps of our lives seems unassailable thats at least partly our fault says vaidhyanathan for too long weve treated googles technologies as harmless magic and google as some kind of exception to capitalisms rules look its the most interesting company in the world he says but its still a company it wont always be working in the public interest and thats ok companies dont always work in our interest once we recognise that these companies are not our protectors we can approach them reasonably and find the right political framework for the next google or facebook eventually to rise and replace the current ones the future is coming the cars will navigate themselves googles latest prototype doesnt even have a steering wheel

eu ruling on link removal deeply immoral says wikipedia founder this is the first time any entries to the online encyclopedia will be removed from google search and follows the removal of links to thousands of web pages  including some on the telegraph website the eus right to be forgotten legislation allows european citizens to request that links to inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant information be removed from search results the result is an internet riddled with orwells memory holes   cases where inconvenient information simply disappears 
right to be forgotten most of us are still trying to be remembered the famous dream of being wiped from the web take former formula one head max mosley who has launched legal action against google demanding the removal of images of him at a sex party from the search engine most of the rest of us know all too well about being forgotten a blog i began a few years ago  a stunningly successful experiment in national secrecy located several thousand miles up a winding gorge in the outer reaches of the internet  had like most blogs all the virtual footfall of a moon crater in low season in terms of impact id have made more of an impression standing on an upturned bucket beside a motorway performing interpretative dance to passing truck drivers im not alone from musicians to entrepreneurs writers to pop up burger chefs millions are desperately perspiring at the coal face of the attention economy one hundred and eighty one million blogs were recorded by nielsen in 2011 the best part of half a billion tweets are now sent daily facebook blogger and twitter regularly invite us to study the analytics for our posts and pages i always make sure i can see the twitter screen on my laptop when i am writing self publishing author ben galley declares just one of an army of unpaid e authors who rise at dawn to promote themselves on social media before their paid job a raft of startups like clicksubmit and outbrain promise to get you noticed on the net trades from handymen to hoteliers face the prospect that unless they get busily networking to take on airbnb and other web 20 disrupters theyll end up biting analogue dust and yet with the rise of erase your history software such as x pire and ephemeral apps like snapchat and wickr we seem preoccupied with an urge for removal and erasure  an idea now enshrined in european legislation whether individuals have the right to remove their own digital footprint is a good question but it ignores the plight of a much larger but less celebrated group those working hard at being remembered in the first place here we meet some grim realities the average blog is followed by a handful of readers while 90 of tweets are never retweeted stories of twitter cascades and viral news are skewed by concentrating on the tiny proportion of success stories  while audiences of mere handfuls greet millions of hopeful uploaders on to youtube soundcloud and kindle most self published ebooks sell fewer than 100 copies  in other words the social web is a place of stark power law distributions  a tiny number of people commanding all of the attention while the vast majority languish on the long tail heard seen and read by almost nobody most online article pages are read only for a few seconds before large numbers of their readers bounce search engines quickly bury old news beneath a tidal wave of the new by saturating us with a sea of information the web acts like a giant version of orwells memory hole  consigning thoughts fears and feelings to virtual oblivion by covering them with ceaseless white noise  while at the same time preserving the worst of the little brother volunteer surveillance state embarrassing selfies and party pics unfair reviews  a misjudged tweet with disastrous consequences the result is a vast lumpen commentariat who have the right to say anything so long as none of it leaves a lasting impression governments are well aware of this power of media saturation as a tool for inducing political amnesia while 20th century censorship worked mostly by suppressing the information supply in our own age armies of volunteer piece workers such as chinas 50 cent party are paid to obfuscate hot issues by incessant and irrelevant blogging such spamizdat is also alive and well in democratic countries with bombardment techniques like astroturfing and snowing as we risk being drowned in the din and the demands of the attention economy creep upwards we should spare a thought for the millions blogging uploading and tweeting in the hope someone will notice they have the right to be remembered as well as forgotten 
revenge porn why the right to be forgotten is the right remedy revenge porn is an undoubtedly vile phenomenon a couple often young and foolish with lust get together and share trust and intimacy in the modern style they take pictures or videos of each other or sext each other revealing selfies then they break up and he posts these pictures on a website and labels her a whore to the world this is of course a very partial description revenge porn can cut across same sex as well as heterosexual couples and can be done by the girl to the boy as much as the other way round yet revenge porn is typically one of the nastiest offshoots of the misogynistic abuse rampant and normalised in the online space as seen in recent cases like the criado perez and stella creasy twitter abuse storms how then do we try to stop revenge porn as we undoubtedly should the kneejerk reaction  which we saw in hasty and ill crafted amendments to the criminal justice and courts bill last week  is to say something must be done new criminal laws must be passed sentences must be extended draconian powers must be given demanding all social networks institute real name policies even though these would be unenforceable and harm the vulnerable more than abusers  new laws necessary and counter productive a timely house of lords select committee report  released today points out that something has already been done and that even with a new phenomenon like revenge porn new laws are both unnecessary and quite possibly counter productive in oral evidence given to the committee the police civil rights organisations social networks and a leading qc all pointed out that in fact we already have a multiplicity of overlapping criminal laws in place around harassment threats menace and abuse which apply as much to the online world as the offline adding new laws to this existing jungle is likely to confuse the public perplex arresting police and mystify the internet abuse teams which work across time zones on an international scale rather than looking at the laws of one small island it would also be likely to lend scope to ill conceived prosecutions jeopardising ordinary free speech rights such as the notorious twitter joke trial the us experience sadly about six months to a year in advance of the uk is that what victims of revenge porn really want most urgently is a remedy not a prosecution while pictures of women branded as sluts victims home wreckers etc stay accessible on the internet job opportunities new relationships college entry and basic self esteem are wrecked on many us based sites images stay up till blackmail is paid responsible sites such as facebook twitter and tumblr depend on the goodwill of their clientele and are already responsive to take down requests although possibly not as fast as could be hoped  see below but because websites hosted in the us benefit from a law which gives them complete immunity from prosecution or action relating to content posted by users smaller less reputable sites   like the notorious myexcom or isanybodyupcom   can refuse to take down revenge porn without incurring legal liability and do so as a lucrative business model increasingly uk and eu women will find images of themselves sickeningly on these sites and uk prosecutions or longer sentences will do little or nothing to help a good remedy for the uk thus involves two steps  mandatory take down of images posted without consent from hosting sites in the uk and if take down is not obtainable because the host site is in the us and hiding behind a liability shield a right to removal of the link from googles memory so a search on a name will not bring up as first result shocking pictures posted and hosted without consent many press reports have responded negatively to the recent google spain european court of justice case  which held that a person has the right to have a link relating to their name which is inaccurate misleading or distressing removed from the search engine  the so called right to be forgotten whether you view this as a vindication of basic rights to control our own personal data online or a worrying trend for the public record online it is an undoubted godsend to revenge porn victims google is the search engine of choice for around 90 of european users  if a link vanishes from their index the content essentially ceases to exist some will say this is an after the fact remedy and that we still need to make examples to stop people doing it in the first place we again already have a law the same law used in the recent high profile twitter cases which criminalises malicious threatening or grossly offensive speech sent through email or posted online again the lords report calls usefully for it to be clarified if grossly offensive does cover revenge porn for which there is currently no clear case law long term revenge porn just like twitter misogyny and the kind of racist and homophobic abuse routinely hurled online at people like tom daley and felix mwamba is not a criminal law problem but a social problem we need by education in schools and homes by peer pressure and most immediately by swift and resolute response from hosting social networks to show that this behaviour is unacceptable facebook and twitter both revealed in oral evidence to the lords that their abuse response teams  for their global markets not the uk  were in the low hundreds not the thousands they also pointedly refused to say how many abuse complaints they received per day what their clean up rate was or the speed of response victims complain that response from abuse teams takes too long and is hesitant when it comes facebook and twitters watchword is self help  block your abuser from your twitter feed ask your troll to stop tagging pictures of you blocking in revenge porn especially does precisely no good since the image is still out there destroying reputations self help is of course much cheaper and easier for the networks than investing in real time monitoring or intervention worse is the frequent suggestion that women who suffer on social networks should simply withdraw from the internet in todays world the internet is a vital part of all lives and asking women to withdraw from it to some kind of digital purdah is in itself shockingly misogynistic as criado perez herself recently said  when a woman does speak up she runs the risk of being shouted down by a society that is still so scared of a womans voice it must silence it by any means necessary   including the threat of rape of death to that society women must shout back and louder until a womans voice is as unremarkable as a mans only then will we combat the fear of a womans voice only then will we live in a democracy worth the name

google approves 50000 right to be forgotten requests around 50000 requests have been approved for removal from googles european search results reuters google has complied with more than half of all link removal requests from its european search results following the european unions right to be forgotten ruling in may since the legislation was introduced google has received around 90000 requests from individuals seeking to remove links containing personal information that they believe is no longer relevant around 50000 of which were approved google   along with other search companies microsoft and yahoo   on thursday met with eu regulators to seek clarification about how the ruling was bring implemented citing sources familiar with the matter both the wall street journal and reuters say that google has rejected about 30 of claims and sought extra information in 15 of cases for a search result to be removed the ruling by the european court of justice requires that theres a public interest in the information   for example information about financial scams professional malpractice criminal convictions or public conduct of government officials such a high removal rate is an indication of how broadly the ruling is being implemented however the search engine giant came under fire yesterday from regulators for its method of removal currently results are only removed from european search sites like googlecouk and googlefr meaning web users searching for the information on googlecom can easily access it google has previously stated that it was disappointed with the ruling to introduce the legislation which has also faced criticism from free speech advocates there is a significant difficult and philosophical question to be answered around the balance between privacy and free speech jimmy wales founder of wikipedia told ibtimes uk at the time of the ruling i think what this decision highlights is that weve got that balance all wrong wales is serving on an advisory board assembled by google to look into how right to be forgotten requests can be dealt with 
google admits to errors over guardian right to be forgotten link deletions under a european court judgment google may have to remove web links if it receives a complaint photograph michael gottschalkphotothekgetty images google has acknowledged that it incorrectly removed links to several guardian articles last month and then reinstated them after complaints from people citing the right to be forgotten following a european court ruling google is required to remove links to inadequate irrelevent or  excessive information from its search results in eu countries if the person to which the web page relates places a complaint subject to a public interest test but in a comment piece in the guardian googles chief legal officer david drummond acknowledged that the company which opposes the ruling was still working out the right way to implement the judgment and had made some errors the guardian was one of the first outlets to be notified that some of its content had been removed from some eu search results receiving six notification that articles had been affected four of those articles were subsequently reinstated into search results by google if complainants wish to challenge reinstatements they must do so through their countrys information commissioners office drummond said google disagreed with the ruling but said the company respected the courts authority and was doing its very best to comply quickly and responsibly he promised the public debate would affect how the company made its decisions on removing or reinstating content for the 250000 requests it had received from more than 70000 people of course only two months in our process is still very much a work in progress he wrote its why we incorrectly removed links to an article last week since been reinstated but the good news is that the ongoing active debate thats happening will inform the development of our principles policies and practices in particular about how to balance one persons right to privacy with anothers right to know drummond also announced that google had set up an advisory council of experts to examine the right to be forgotten issue jimmy wales wikipedia founder and internet campaigner will sit on the panel as will le mondes editorial director sylvie kauffmann and the un special rapporteur frank la rue the advisory council would take evidence from appropriate bodies and interest groups as well as hold public meetings drummond said it would produce a public report on some of the more difficult points concerning the right to be forgotten including issues about spent criminal convictions and victims of abuse as well as the wider societal implications of the courts ruling 
google is being forced to censor the history of merrill lynch  and that should terrify you goog the european unions new law giving people a right to be forgotten which requires google to remove links to information about them is having exactly the effect its critics predicted it is censoring the internet giving new tools that help the rich and powerful and ordinary folk hide negative information about them and letting criminals make their histories disappear exhibit a google was required to delete this bbc article about stan oneal  the former ceo of merrill lynch oneal led the bank in the mid 2000s a period when it became dangerously over exposed to the looming mortgage crisis when the crisis hit merrills losses were so great the bank had to be sold to bank of america oneal lost his job but he exited with a 1615 million golden parachute there is nothing incorrect in the post in fact its a rather mild account of oneals incompetence during the period oneal was forced out of the company after he began discussing selling it without informing his board of directors this is ancient well established history having it removed from google doesnt undo the fact that it happened but there is a new generation of 25 year old investment bankers who perhaps do not have a firm grasp of the 2007 crisis that reshaped banking globally their grasp will be ever more slightly weaker due to this new law there is an argument that in removing the blog google is confirming the fears of many in the industry that the right to be forgotten will be abused to curb freedom of expression and to suppress legitimate journalism that is in the public interest bbc writer robert peston says six links to stories in the guardian not related to oneal have also been removed also business insider previously noted that deletion requests were granted for a former politician who wanted to remove links to a news article about his behavior when previously in office  so that he can have a clean slate when running for a new position  and a man who was convicted of possessing child sexual abuse imagery so pedophiles can take advantage of this law as well forgetme a company that expedites google deletion requests tells business insider that it is fielding 250 requests per day heres a breakdown of what is being deleted from the worlds greatest search engine its exactly like the memory holes in george orwells 1984 in which big brothers minions burn information that the government wants people to forget but the eu law is terrifying for another reason the entire process is so non transparent that the consequence for the individual is even worse than what the courts intended this excellent discussion from danny sullivan at marketinglandcom shows that even when google removes links new ones pop up in their place and europeans can get the full uncensored internet by leaving googlecouk and searching at googlecom heres a uk search result for the stan oneal article note the disclosure from google that its results have been censored sullivan then searched for the name of the first commenter on the article and got this we dont know whether it was oneal who asked that the link be removed in fact oneals name may be being dragged through the mud unnecessarily here peston believes it may be someone mentioned by readers in the comments section under his story about the ruling he suggests that as a peter dragomer search triggers the same disclosure that a result may have been censored that perhaps it was not oneal who requested the deletion in an amazing coincidence the person posting as peter dragomer claims to be an ex merrill employee right now thousands of people probably think that stan oneal is on some quixotic quest to make people forget that he was at the wheel when merrill drove off a cliff and there is no evidence that thats the case but because the law exists we have no idea what the truth is that ought to worry everyone 
why has google cast me into oblivion 2 july 2014 last updated at 1725 why has google cast me into oblivion this morning the bbc received the following notification from google notice of removal from google search we regret to inform you that we are no longer able to show the following pages from your website in response to certain searches on european versions of google httpwwwbbccoukblogslegacythereporters robertpeston200710merrills_messhtml what it means is that a blog i wrote in 2007 will no longer be findable when searching on google in europe which means that to all intents and purposes the article has been removed from the public record given that google is the route to information and stories for most people so why has google killed this example of my journalism well it has responded to someone exercising his or her new right to be forgotten following a ruling in may by the european court of justice that google must delete inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant data from its results when a member of the public requests it track record the ruling stemmed from a case brought by mario costeja gonzlez after he failed to secure the deletion of a 1998 auction notice of his repossessed home that was reported in a spanish newspaper now in my blog only one individual is named he is stan oneal the former boss of the investment bank merrill lynch my column describes how oneal was forced out of merrill after the investment bank suffered colossal losses on reckless investments it had made is the data in it inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant most people would argue that it is highly relevant for the track record good or bad of a business leader to remain on the public record   especially someone widely seen as having played an important role in the worst financial crisis in living memory merrill went to the brink of collapse the following year and was rescued by bank of america public interest so there is an argument that in removing the blog google is confirming the fears of many in the industry that the right to be forgotten will be abused to curb freedom of expression and to suppress legitimate journalism that is in the public interest to be fair to google it opposed the european court ruling but its implementation of it looks odd perhaps clumsy maybe i am a victim of teething problems it is only a few days since the ruling has been implemented   and google tells me that since then it has received a staggering 50000 requests for articles to be removed from european searches it has hired what it calls an army of para legals to process these requests i asked google if i can appeal against the casting of my article into the oblivion of unsearchable internet data google is getting back to me ps although the bbc has had the notice from google that my article will not show up in some searches it doesnt appear to have implemented this yet 
izvestia reports that the russian navy will soon be outfitted with unmanned watercraft in the next two years the defense ministry hopes to develop and deploy underwater gliders capable of operating up to 90 days in a row these barely detectable devices will essentially become a maritime counterpart to intelligence gathering uavs detecting and transmitting in real time to navy command the torpedo looking watercraft has two sealed chambers  one with air and another with a special liquid the seal between the chambers compresses and expands air volume thus regulating the gliders immersion the glider orients itself with a propeller rudders and an internal counterweight while the gliders speed is only two kilometers per hour the device spends very little energy and thus can work for several months in a row the newspaper reminds that first developments in this field were initially reported in 2012 former chief of navy staff viktor kravchenko told the newspaper that the drones will be able to monitor watercraft activity and take various readings  water salinity temperature and sonic signals rbc daily reports that according to gazprombank experts russias gdp can grow in just five years by 15 or 10 trillion rubles in order to achieve that the government needs to eliminate state procurement barriers for small and medium businesses and increase productivity the bulk of the potential gdp growth  about five trillion rubles  can be achieved by boosting completion especially in b2b and state procurements natalya prokhorova leading expert of gazprombanks economic forecast center said government procurement and digital tenders analysis illustrates that 15 of efficiency is lost due to a large number of middle men and price jacking even though the system is being overhauled its not perfect public officials admit for instance only 10 of procurement auctions are awarded to small and medium businesses the daily notes as far as labor efficiency goes it can boost the gdp by 15 trillion  and according to experts it does not necessarily lead to unemployment first vice president of gazprombank ekaterina trofimova told the newspaper that the myth about lacking mobility of the population was dispelled by metallurgy workers relocation program moskovskiy komsomolets reports that the united states plans to launch a massive expansion of liquifed natural gas lng exports however according to the article the giant ambition is standing or rather fragile legs the price of shale gas which the us plans to export is significantly higher than that of traditional fuel moreover one should take into consideration transport and infrastructure costs associated with the endeavor russias president vladimir putin already publicly stated that american shale gas will definitely be more expensive than gazproms product the article provides expert opinion backing up this statement for example mikhail krutikhin partner at rusenergy consulting company noted that lng terminals need to be constructed in order to facilitate gas export from the us to other countries the first terminal of its kind can only be built in three years while alaska has several such terminals theyre outdated and insufficient for the planned expansion the same goes for gas fields  shale gas exports can reach sufficient volume only by 2020 with ukraine georgia and moldova set to sign the economic sections of association agreements with the european union on friday the moscow times writes that analysts say the deals will have minimal impact on the russian economy on the other hand these developments will further broaden the political rift between russia and its neighbors the daily reports that russia should not lose more than 1 billion euros in the next few years as a result of ukraines signing of the eu deal according to one russian economist alexei makarkin deputy director of the center of political technologies think tank in moscow said current and former cis countries have a clear choice either they join the eurasian economic union with russia or associate themselves with the european union russia will react negatively to these signings not because of their economic nature but because it views this as european expansionism into its traditional sphere of influence overall experts believe that long term effects of the eu association agreements will depend on how russia handles policies with soviet republics and whether its customs union partners will be able to influence its decisions google has begun removing search links to content in europe under the right to be forgotten ruling which obliges it not to point to web pages with outdated or irrelevant information about individuals the guardian reports that searches made on googles services in europe using peoples names includes a section at the bottom with the phrase some results may have been removed under data protection law in europe and a link to a page explaining the ruling by the european court of justice ecj in may 2014 however searches made on googlecom the us based service do not include the same warning because the ecj ruling only applies within europe the daily clarifies google would not say how many peoples search histories have been tweaked nor how many web pages have been affected the company revealed in an interview with chief executive larry page at the end of may that it had received thousands of requests for changes to search results within days of the ecj ruling the washington post writes that the german government has canceled a contract with the us telecommunications giant verizon communications as part of an overhaul of its internal communications prompted by revelations last year of us government spying the daily reminds that reports based on disclosures by former us intelligence contractor edward snowden alleged that the national security agency had conducted mass surveillance in germany and had even eavesdropped on chancellor angela merkels cell phone berlin then demanded talks with washington on a  no spy deal but these collapsed after the united states appeared unwilling to give the assurances that germany wanted germanys interior ministry said in a statement thursday  the pressures on networks as well as the risks from highly developed viruses or trojans are rising furthermore the ties revealed between foreign intelligence agencies and firms in the wake of the us national security agency nsa affair show that the german government needs a very high level of security for its critical networks 
google search results may indicate right to be forgotten censorship google may include an alert on search results pages to indicate legally requested links have been removed google is planning to flag up search results it has censored following a controversial ruling that allows european citizens the right to demand information on them be erased the search engine is considering placing an alert at the bottom of each page where it has removed links in the wake of the landmark right to be forgotten ruling last month the decision by europes highest court allows people living in europe to ask for links to inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant material to be removed from search results although it will still be available on the original web page google has since been deluged with tens of thousands of requests from internet users to take down sensitive information on them since the ruling by the european court of justice ecj on 13 may it is understood google is planning to flag censored search results in a similar way to how it alerts users to takedown requests over copyright infringing material for example a google search for adele mp3 shows that it has removed a number of results from that page after receiving complaints under the us digital millennium copyright act google is also planning to include information about right to be forgotten removals in its biannual transparency report which reveals the number of government requests worldwide to remove material from its search results google said last monday that it had so far received 41000 requests to take down sensitive material from people in europe since the landmark ruling including a politician with a murky past a convicted paedophile and a man who had attempted to murder his family and wanted to remove links about his crime google chief executive larry page has said that nearly a third of the 41000 requests received related to a fraud or scram one fifth concerned serious crime and 12 are connected to child pornography arrests the search company which launched an online form two weeks ago for people wanting to airbrush material about their past does not have to comply with every request but must consider whether removing information is in the public interest google has set up an advisory committee to issue recommendations about where the boundaries of the public interest lie in the requests made up of seven people including its executive chairman eric schmidt and wikipedia founder jimmy wales wales has described the ecj ruling as censorship and raised concerns that news organisations would be particularly affected because google is the primary source through which internet users find information in an interview with the technology site techcrunch on this weekend wales said i think the decision will have no impact on peoples right to privacy  because i dont regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information if anything the decision is likely to simply muddle the interesting philosophical questions and make it more difficult to make real progress on privacy issues in the case of truthful non defamatory information obtained legally i think there is no possibility of any defensible right to censor what other people are saying google declined to comment 
google begins implementation of right to be forgotten ruling with online takedown form the online form is applicable to search results not the content itself that individuals think contain information that is irrelevant outdated or otherwise inappropriate googles new search removal request form as it appears on their website well also be working with data protection authorities and others as we implement this ruling google co founder and ceo larry page admitted the company needs to be more european in its outlook thats one of the things weve taken from this that were starting the process of really going and talking to people some have pointed out that reactions to the ruling are split broadly upon transatlantic lines with american commentators more likely to categorise the right to be forgotten as a  blow against free speech  while european counterparts are more likely to view it as a practical tool that helps ordinary individuals control the information circulated about them 
what did the media miss with the right to be forgotten coverage the fallout from the recent european court of justice ruling on the right to be forgotten has reached far and wide in the past week prompting an international discussion about how personal information is used online but there is another perspective the internet is robust but dont touch it the alarmist position generally proceeds as follows the first and most compelling point is the assertion that the european court failed to balance rights to privacy and personal data against freedom of expression and information third the argument is embellished with emotive claims about how this ruling will fragment chill choke censor or somehow damage the internet the counter argument is that this position demonstrates a failure of imagination the sacrificing of creativity to inertia instead of harbouring despicable behaviour that wed find unacceptable offline what if the internet became more forgiving and accommodating  outdated law can now be bolstered there are as many points of view as there are academics but if there was any consensus in their response it was that mainstream coverage of the ruling failed to critically interrogate the industry response or to understand the complex legal precedent it presents yet most also agree that the fault for this lies mainly with the regime created by the 1995 eu data protection directive it rather missed the memo about life in the google age in its zealous fortification of external handling of personal data the result erdos describes is that the vision of the founders of european data protection is in profound tension with the whole way in which information is disseminated and sought out online including not only by large corporations such as google but also by hundreds of millions of individuals instead it called out the great sleeping lie of the routine non application of data protection law by doing so it has provided an essential platform for public debate technology is a necessary agent in applying the ruling in the meantime however google must adapt to this immediate ruling the alarmists as well as some academics  call this impractical invoking that lamentable bulwark of justice pragmatism as evgeny morozov points out google is a paragon for the data hungry the superficially appealing claim that it should be uncensored in satisfying the right to knowledge has dangerous implications if we think of banks insurance companies and so on google of course has considerably more resources than dowdy data protection offices and as the court recognised a significant influence on the lives of many individuals however it is clear that technology facilitated solutions are the only option if we intend to realise data protection at scale fragile but important social norms can now be respected perhaps the most insidious aspect of the alarmist view is that it completely overlooks the precious and important social values at stake here a society that respects autonomy and values forgiveness this is a legitimate desire it is this potential for rehabilitation for second chances that is under assault from google the ability to let people move on is a deeply held social value and one that we should exercise graciously julia powles is a researcher in law and technology at the university of cambridge 
google cant forget you but it should make you hard to find illustration getty images as soon as news spread that the european court of justice now requires search engines like google to allow people to  be forgotten after a certain time by erasing links to web pages  critics in the us worried that the decision would break the internet while theres good reason to disagree with the european ruling we should avoid being too self congratulatory as our the recent snapchat debacle illustrates the language thats driving key privacy discussions worldwide is fostering false expectations and diverting attention away from what should be the focal point the proper way to enhance or preserve obscurity getting google to forget isnt the same thing as getting people to forget we get it the right to be forgotten sounds catchy and yes the language of erasure laws and disappearing messages is captivating unfortunately these popular words are fatally inaccurate in the privacy context as a result critics risk tackling irrelevant arguments about unattainable perfection while advocates and consumers are invited to place their hopes in a technology that is doomed never to be fully successful impassioned defenses of the right to be forgotten all too easily conjure up images of tweaking google to create collective amnesia its as if removing a google link douses the world in forget me now pills or zaps us with men in black neuralyzers  preventing us from recalling that the man who started the eu lawsuit mario gonzalez once had debt problems having google delete links to information cant make anyone forget anything it can make it harder for people who didnt know that gonzalez was a debtor to discover that fact and it can make it harder for people who once knew this fact to recall it at later date but getting google to forget isnt the same thing as getting people to forget this isnt to say widespread use of online technology doesnt affect our memory relying on search engines changes transactive memory just as you dont need to strain to memorize birthdays if your spouse can do so easily you can turn to google to reliably locate extensive information thanks to cognitive offloading  google maps lets us get by much of the time without memorizing travel routes but the very idea of a right to be forgotten suggests a different view of the relationship between technology and memory it can mislead us into thinking of links on google as essentially like phone numbers stored on digital contact lists true if we dont back those lists up then losing them effectively entails forgetting but that is different its not new information such as google linking to disclosures of other peoples financial trouble were unaware of the differences between recall and discovery invisibility and non existence need to be salient in this debate evan selinger and woodrow hartzog evan selinger is a fellow at the institute for ethics and emerging technology who focuses on the collisions between technology ethics and law at rochester institute of technology selinger is associate professor of philosophy and is affiliated with the center for media arts games interaction  creativity magic woodrow hartzog is an associate professor at samford universitys cumberland school of law his research focuses on privacy and technology he is also an affiliate scholar at the center for internet and society at stanford law school indeed the predictable coverage of mario costeja gonzlezs legal struggle proved that the right to be forgotten is a misnomer thats doomed to fail critics of the courts decision found it ironic that a spotlight was cast on the objectionable information that the plaintiff wanted to go away john oliver pointed this out brilliantly on sunday night if a full fledged right to be forgotten existed it would be incompatible with the risk of the streisand effect that everyone faces when pushing for momentous legal reform among other things forgetting would require the eu court to extract gonzlezs name from the legal records and prohibit google from  linking to the search results containing the opinion or any news articles about the opinion  university of chicago law professor eric posner thus hits the nail on the head when he asserts that the right to be forgotten is not a right to be purged from the memory of people who know you but rather to control how information about you appears online the same weaknesses that plague the phrasing of the right to be forgotten are also haunting a new breed of promising ephemeral media such as snapchat the federal trade commission recently settled a dispute with snapchat over allegations that the app falsely represented messages sent through the application as disappearing forever after the user set time expires according to the ftc these messages actually persisted on mobile devices and could be retrieved numerous ways with minimal hassle misdescribing that expiration function led some users to believe their messages were fading into oblivion instead of simply becoming invisible to the recipient while still accumulating in every participating data storage device of course this limitation doesnt mean that the technology is useless quite to the contrary snapchat is ideal for sharing information that isnt overly sensitive yet in the aggregate might raise privacy concerns critics who lament that the app isnt foolproof tend to overlook this point and act as if the all personal information that we have privacy interest in is radioactive like nude selfies nude selfies arent the only kind of thing a person might not want easily available for people to see a similar mistake is made by critics of eraser laws like the one recently enacted in california  which gives minors the right to delete information they previously posted but doesnt apply to re posts by third parties naysayers insist the law cant meet its goal because it wont erase the infamous viral posts many users would come to regret technically speaking this criticism is true but it overlooks why the law is still effective in a non trivial way it makes it harder to discover information online that minors find problematic this point about legislation providing some but not absolute protection would have been easier to appreciate had the erasure button law been given a different title maybe the reducing the likelihood of harm law yes this isnt a catchy description but its significantly more accurate as are terms like invisible in the user interface instead of disappearing messages and the right to make information harder to find instead of the right to be forgotten this debate is not and should not be about forgetting or disappearing in the traditional sense instead lets recognize that the talk about forgetting and disappearing is really concern about the concept of obscurity in the protection of our personal information so how about we make a pact to resist using language like the right to be forgotten eraser laws and disappearing messages and focus on developing messages laws and technologies that focus on enhancing obscurity so how about we make a pact to resist using language like the right to be forgotten eraser laws and disappearing messages as weve previously written obscurity is the idea that when information is hard to obtain or understand it is to some degree safe safety here doesnt mean inaccessible competent and determined data hunters armed with the right tools can always find a way to get it less committed folks however experience great effort as a deterrent by accurately identifying the obscurity issues at stake where privacy is being discussed we can move beyond nirvana fallacies to answer the difficult but critical policy questions for example how easy should it be to find personal information about you does it matter what kind of personal information it is which obscurity strategies are acceptable and which ones are problematic most people dont have a problem with privacy settings delete buttons for user profiles robottxt files scraping prohibitions in terms of use agreements and other similar commonly deployed technologies that foster obscurity yet the european court of justices recent decision providing for a right to have information removed from certain search results has struck many as going too far could obscurity be leveraged to carve out a  right to fail  would a compromise be degrading the page rank of certain results and is that a bad thing or a valuable protection in itself as harvard law professor jonathan zittrain points out  the second page of search resultsmight as well be in siberia poor search visibility is in itself an extremely valuable obscurity protection because of the high transactional cost of finding information that isnt easily uncovered by a simple search the admitted weakness of couching privacy protection in terms of the probability of obscurity is that youre forced to recognize the inevitability of some information slipping through the cracks of obscurity and going viral this admission is necessary however because it not only allows those who are disclosing information to better tailor their expectations but it also encourages the public and policy makers to demand an elevated response when mere probabilities wont do course correcting wont occur overnight but to begin the most important thing we need to forget is the word itself 
politician and paedophile ask google to be forgotten 15 may 2014 last updated at 1244 politician and paedophile ask google to be forgotten by jane wakefield technology reporter the right to be forgotten ruling set a precedent for the removal of search results in europe google has received fresh takedown requests after a european court ruled that an individual could force it to remove irrelevant and outdated search results the bbc has learned an ex politician seeking re election has asked to have links to an article about his behaviour in office removed a man convicted of possessing child abuse images has requested links to pages about his conviction to be wiped and a doctor wants negative reviews from patients removed from the results google itself has not commented on the so called right to be forgotten ruling since it described the the european court of justice judgement as being disappointing nor has it released any figures about the number of take down requests received since tuesday the original case was brought by a spanish man who complained that an auction notice of his repossessed home on googles search results had infringed his privacy eu commissioner viviane reding said the decision was a clear victory for the protection of personal data of europeans but others are concerned about the consequences that it will have for search engines and others wikipedia founder jimmy wales has criticised the ruling calling it astonishing while free speech advocates at the index on censorship said the courts ruling should send chills down the spine of everyone in the european union who believes in the crucial importance of free expression and freedom of information the court has said that an individuals desires outweigh societys interest in the complete facts around incidents they added 
european court google must yield on personal info in a landmark ruling that could rock the internet search engine industry europes highest court said tuesday that people are entitled to some control over what pops up when their name is googled the court of justice of the european union eu said google must listen and sometimes comply when individuals ask the search giant to remove links to newspaper articles or websites containing information about them the ruling applies to all search engines in europe including yahoo and microsofts bing it is less clear whether it will affect the way search engines operate in the united states and elsewhere around the world nor is it clear how exactly the court envisions google and others handling complaints digital rights experts said the decision by the top court in the 28 nation eu puts privacy ahead of freedom of information and they warned it could lead to online censorship no room for appeal google said it was disappointed by the ruling   which cannot be appealed   but was still studying its implications the eu which would be the worlds largest economy if its 28 countries were counted as one has a population of over 500 million the case was referred to the european court from spains national court which asked for advice in the case of mario costeja a spaniard who found a search on his name turned up links to a notice that his property was due to be auctioned because of an unpaid welfare debt the notice had been published in a spanish newspaper in 1998 and was tracked by googles robots when the newspaper digitised its archive costeja argued that the debt had long since been settled and he asked the spanish privacy agency to have the reference removed in 2010 the agency agreed but google refused and took the matter to court saying it should not be asked to censor material that had been legally published by the newspaper its a great relief to be shown that you were right when you have fought for your ideas its a joy costeja told the associated press in a telephone interview if google was great before its perfect now because there are game rules to go by he said that ordinary people will know where they have to go to complain about bad or old information that turns up on a google search costejas case will now return to spain for final judgment there are about 200 others in the spanish court system some of which may still prove difficult to decide for instance one involves a plastic surgeon who wants mentions of a botched operation removed from googles results in its ruling the european court said people may address requests directly to the operator of the search engine which must then duly examine its merits the right is not absolute as search engines must weigh the legitimate interest of internet users potentially interested in having access to that information against the right to privacy when an agreement cant be reached the luxembourg based court said the matter can be referred to a local judge or regulator debates over the right to be forgotten   to have negative information erased after a period of time   have surfaced across the world as tech users struggle to reconcile the forgive and forget nature of human relations with the permanence of the internet though the idea of such a right has generally been well received in europe many in the us have criticised it as a disguised form of censorship that could for example allow convicts to delete references to past crimes or politicians to airbrush their records ruling first of its kind alejandro tourino a spanish lawyer who specialises in mass media issues said the ruling was a first of its kind and quite a blow for google google spokesman al verney said the ruling was disappointing for search engines and online publishers in general some limited forms of a right to be forgotten exist in the us and elsewhere   for example in regard to crimes committed by minors or bankruptcy regulations both of which usually require that records be expunged in some way however the burden falls on the publisher of the information usually a government   not on search engines viviane reding the eus top justice official said in a facebook posting that the ruling confirmed that data belongs to the individual and that unless there is a good reason to retain data an individual should be empowered by law to request erasure however javier ruiz policy director at open rights group a british based organisation cautioned that authorities have to be careful in how they move forward we need to take into account individuals right to privacy he said but if search engines are forced to remove links to legitimate content that is already in the public domain it could lead to online censorship 
on californias bizarre internet eraser law for teenagers california has passed a well intentioned law allowing teens to scrub their youthful indiscretions from the internet starting in 2015 any minor can request that a digital service provider delete pictures of themselves passed out drunk at a justin bieber concert the law doesnt make a whole lot of sense since nearly every imaginable service offers a delete button perhaps more importantly it ignores the reality that its nearly impossible to delete information from the net embarrassing photos spread virally and internet archives automatically create copies of nearly every piece of information on the web yet as written it appears to create a head on collision between privacy law and the first amendment there are no clear rules on what will survive when a friend comments or interacts with a given piece of regrettable content that will inevitably end up being deleted the web is chaotic viral and interconnected either the law is completely toothless or it sets in motion a very scary anti information snowball the law as written california sb 658 requires the operator of an internet web site online service online application or mobile application to permit a minor who is a registered user of the operators internet web site online service online application or mobile application to remove or to request and obtain removal of content or information posted the law kicks in on january 1st just in time for hung over minors to delete their new years eve shenanigans it also prohibits websites from targeting minors with a host of fun yet regrettable products such as e cigarettes and tattoos not realistic if a vengeful ex boyfriend shares a naughty picture of his former lover with the facebook universe sb 658 doesnt give a minor the right to erase it users can only delete data they upload also if a teenage mother posts a picture of her toddler toking weed out of a bong thats also exempt law enforcement can subpoena the information perhaps most importantly more and more of the social media world is automatically archived the sunlight foundation for instance automatically archives tweets in case a politician deletes one some deleted tweets are pretty hilarious on top of all this nearly every website imaginable permits users to delete a post so in reality the law is completely unrealisticunnecessary still james steyer chief executive of child advocacy group common sense media calls the law a very important milestone 4th vs 1st amendment as written the law is about giving a specific group prone to stupid decisions the ability to delete information they dont like in this in comes dangerously close to the european unions proposed  right to be forgotten  the right to be forgotten could make facebook and google for example liable for up to two percent of their global income if they fail to remove photos that people post about themselves and later regret even if the photos have been widely distributed already explains jeffrey rosen a law professor at george washington university while sb 658 attempts to restrain court orders to information that hasnt been reposted by other users its not clear how that would work in practice if for instance i like a photo of my friend at a strip club but he later wants it erased what should happen facebook likes are now protected as first amendment speech to have any sort of teeth the law will eventually have to permit the erasure of data that has been reposted archived or interacted with and as a result must create a grow a whole new body of case law dedicated to choosing when the right to be forgotten trumps our right to share and discuss information the french have already made their decision on this matter  le droit  loubli or the right of obliviona right that allows a convicted criminal who has served his time and been rehabilitated to object to the publication of the facts of his conviction and incarceration explains rosen if eu proposals go through this type of censorship will extend to the internet realistically the only thing sb 658 did was open up a can of worms on the right to erase information from the internet from here things are only going to get more bizarre
