right to be forgotten for european social networks users social network users in europe will be pleased to know that the european union eu will be enshrining a  right to be forgotten online  making sure that prospective employers are unable to check out previously uploaded facebook photos of a user who is in a compromising situation that might affect the outcome of a particular job interview eu justice commissioner viviane reding mentioned in a speech to the european parliament that a us based social network company that has millions of active users in europe needs to comply with eu rules this means that high standards of data privacy in the default setting is mandatory as well as providing the user more control over the type of data displayed we would want to chip in our two cents worth into the entire situation  in the first place if youre uncomfortable with what you upload should others stumble upon it  dont thats the best rule of thumb to avoid any regrets down the road right to be forgotten for european social networks users  by ubergizmo 
the right to be forgotten questioning the nature of online privacy mounting concerns over privacy on the internet have activists challenging their governments for the right to manage their personas online the movement is particularly strong in europe where last year privacy advocates proposed legislation to the european union titled the right to be forgotten if passed the legislation would empower individuals to sue websites and delete just about any information about themselves online also granting people the right to opt in before companies could begin tracking their data in the first place last week spains data protection agency ordered google to remove links to material related to about 90 people including that to a desultory 1991 news story of a surgeons malpractice suit that he eventually won in the us a group called common sense media is particularly concerned about what children are posting on the internet and a parents right to intervene however there is also an important case to be made for disallowing individuals to mitigate their online profile as written in the technology review hosted by massachusetts institute of technology arguably though an internet erase button or a right to be forgotten might do as much harm as good forbes s adam thierer rightly points out that press freedom and the freedom of speech are widely under threat sometimes the right to information ought to outweigh the right to privacy what incentive will there ever be for a journalist to rake muck if the information can simply be taken down upon request every blogger could conceivably be asked at any time to delete any comment on any post ever written thierer notes who makes these calls still it seems reasonable to suggest that there is a gray area for conversation to reach a middle ground common sense media technology review guest blog will there ever be an internet erase button image by dave makes 
eu proposes right to be forgotten by internet firms 23 january 2012   last updated at 0820 et viviane reding said that individuals must be given control over their information a new law promising internet users the right to be forgotten will be proposed by the european commission on wednesday it says people will be able to ask for data about them to be deleted and firms will have to comply unless there are legitimate grounds to retain it the move is part of a wide ranging overhaul of the commissions 1995 data protection directive some tech firms have expressed concern about the reach of the new bill details of the revised law were unveiled by the justice commissioner viviane reding at the digital life design dld conference in munich a spokesman for the commissioner clarified that the action was designed to help teenagers and young adults manage their online reputations these rules are particularly aimed at young people as they are not always as aware as they could be about the consequence of putting photos and other information on social network websites or about the various privacy settings available said matthew newman he noted that this could cause problems later if the users had no way of deleting embarrassing material when applying for jobs however he stressed that it would not give them the right to ask for material such as their police or medical records to be deleted although the existing directive already contains the principle of data minimisation mr newman said that the new law would reinforce the idea by declaring it a right data loss alerts other measures in the bill include an obligation on all firms to notify users and the authorities about data lost through hacking attacks or other breaches as soon as possible ms reding said that she would expect that under normal circumstances this would mean within 24 hours the commissioner said that firms would have to explicitly seek peoples permission to use data about them and could not proceed on the basis of assumed consent in situations where approval was required her proposed law says that internet users must also be notified when their data is collected and be told for what purpose it is being processed and for how long it will be stored the bill also suggests people must be given easier access to the data held on them and should have the right to move it to another provider in addition to the right to have it deleted however the commissioner said that she recognised there were some circumstances under which this right would not apply the archives of a newspaper are a good example it is clear that the right to be forgotten cannot amount to a right of the total erasure of history ms reding told dld delegates if approved the law would create a pan eu set of data privacy rules for the first time these would also apply to overseas companies active in the 27 member bloc even if they handled the data on servers based in other parts of the world the commissioner suggested that this would simplify regulations and reduce the administrative burden on firms saving them around 23bn euros 3bn 19bn a year penalties however microsoft europes chief operating officer ron zink was quoted by the financial times as saying that the proposals might be too prescriptive facebook also signalled that it wanted more information about the scope of the data that the eu thought users should be able to control but it added we welcome vice president redings view that good regulation should encourage job creation and economic growth rather than hindering it and look forward to seeing how the eu data protection directive develops in order to deliver these two goals while safeguarding the rights of internet users google and yahoo said that they were not able to provide statements at this time firms that failed to abide by the proposed new rules could be fined as much as 1 of their global revenues according to a draft document obtained by the reuters news agency the ft had reported in december that the sum could be as much as 5 the new rules will need to be approved by the eus member states and ratified by the european parliament as a result it could take two or more years for the new directive to come into effect 
digital right to be forgotten will be made eu law uk chief executive stephen pattison said that some of the proposed rulessuch as the right to be forgottenraise immediate concerns about compliance costs but more fundamentally we need to understand how the legislation might impact on the development and deployment of new technologies and business models its not clear that the commissions proposals strike the right balance the eu claims that current laws are often conflicting and cost businesses a total of nearly 2bn a year quentin archer a partner at law firm hogan lovells said that the draft regulation will greatly increase the cost of compliance for business particularly in the uk where we have enjoyed a relatively relaxed but pragmatic business friendly regime to date marc dautlich a partner rival firm pinsent masons added that while the new law aims to protect personal data some of the concepts will be extremely expensive for internet businesses to implement for example the right to be forgotten would mean that users could demand that social media networks such as facebook erase any of their comments not just from the network itself but the entire web which would involve unprecedented co operation with search engines to achieve 
the lobbying from all sides has been fierce  absolutely fierce  i have not seen such a heavy lobbying operation she said but the legislation was on the table on the 25th january as i wanted to have it so much to the efficiency of lobbying ms redings regulations seek to harmonise how all data is treated across the 27 eu member states and would give data protection authorities the power to fine companies up to two per cent of global companies if there is a breach she is also seeking to introduce a right to be forgotten which would compel companies to delete or hand over all data they hold on a person on request and to provide it in a form that the individual could take to a rival provider ms reding also said that ambiguity in her regulations was intentional this regulation needs to stand for 30 years  it needs to be very clear but imprecise enough that changes in the markets or public opinions can be manoeuvred in the regulation she said crazy ideas today in three or four years will become a very big commercial success we need to make rules that are capable of adapting themselves to new technologies in the future all these breathtaking possibilities bring about new dangers and the biggest danger is about losing control of your own data the commissioner added that she thought her plans would become a new international standard and that she anticipated american authorities following europes lead 
eu fights fierce lobbying to devise data privacy law so the person must know when they data collectors are giving out data and be transparently informed about what the company to whom it is given is going to do with that data says reding consent to that in clear plain language must be given at the moment nobody is reading the 50 pages of small print terms and conditions  in future it will have to be in a simple understandable language so that people know what they are engaging to but the line of this is very clear no more 50 pages with british citizens routinely offered services from other european countries and america the need for widespread standards has never been greater increased transparency will benefit consumers but the new rules should help businesses too reding claims a single pan european policy will save businesses almost 2 billion a year and hopes that it will become a gold standard for privacy that other countries including america will look towards as they draw up their plans in the future kostas rossoglou of the european consumers organisation says that consumers are sleep walking in a world without privacy they do not realise their data is being collected and processed  yet if something goes wrong say my data gets hacked surely i should be able to get compensation just as when i buy something that doesnt work i can return it he says that the proposals will have an impact on the practices of a lot of online service providers there are two key additions to the plan however reding says she wants her new regulations to be ambiguous this regulation needs to stand for 30 years  it needs to be very clear but imprecise enough that changes in the markets or public opinion can be manoeuvred in the regulation she says all these breathtaking possibilities bring about new dangers and the biggest danger is about losing control of your own data the second crucial right that the e privacy directive adds is the right to be forgotten matthew newman redings spokesman says it simply aggregates existing rights to get data deleted from servers in a timely manner but he says it also means individual eu information commissioners could arbitrate when say a user posts a controversial picture online of someone else and refuses to take it down when the subject asks if no agreement can be reached theoretically the photographer  amateur or professional  could be breaking european law but reding insists the right to be forgotten has nothing to do with journalists nothing to do with the work of bloggers nothing to do with tweeters  its about when you entrust information to a company because freedom of expression is very important we have also to take this into account in an age when everyone can claim to be a citizen journalist preserving privacy is tougher than ever redings aim is to give say new job seekers the right to get embarrassing five year old pictures of university drunkenness taken off the web what if those pictures are posted in multiple places by multiple people reding implies that europe can in some way change the way the web works and get any content removed she is nothing if not ambitious there are strong interests to reconcile on both sides of the debate but reding is confident that she has the legislation she wants she says the lobbying from all sides has been fierce  absolutely fierce i have not seen such a heavy lobbying operation but the legislation was on the table on january 25 as i wanted to have it so much for the efficiency of lobbying 
eu asking google to censor web although reding depicted the new right as a modest expansion of existing data privacy rights in fact it represents the biggest threat to free speech on the internet in the coming decade he writes unless the right is defined more precisely when it is promulgated over the next year or so it could precipitate a dramatic clash between european and american conceptions of the proper balance between privacy and free speech leading to a far less open internet prof rosen admits that in theory the right to be forgotten addresses an urgent problem in the digital age it is very hard to escape your past on the internet now that every photo status update and tweet lives forever in the cloud but he goes on in europe the intellectual roots of the right to be forgotten can be found in french law which recognizes le droit  loubli   or the right of oblivion   a right that allows a convicted criminal who has served his time and been rehabilitated to object to the publication of the facts of his conviction and incarceration in america by contrast publication of someones criminal history is protected by the first amendment leading wikipedia to resist the efforts by two germans convicted of murdering a famous actor to remove their criminal history from the actors wikipedia page prof rosen argues that new regulations however arguably create a legally enforceable right to demand the deletion of any photos or data that i post myself even after theyve gone viral not to mention unflattering photos that include me or information about me that others post whether or not it is true he raises the further fear that the proposed european regulation however treats takedown requests for truthful information posted by others identically to takedown requests for photos ive posted myself that have then been copied by others he warns that if the regulations are implemented as currently proposed its hard to imagine that the internet that results will be as free and open as it is now 
the right to be forgotten although reding depicted the new right as a modest expansion of existing data privacy rights in fact it represents the biggest threat to free speech on the internet in the coming decade the right to be forgotten could make facebook and google for example liable for up to two percent of their global income if they fail to remove photos that people post about themselves and later regret even if the photos have been widely distributed already unless the right is defined more precisely when it is promulgated over the next year or so it could precipitate a dramatic clash between european and american conceptions of the proper balance between privacy and free speech leading to a far less open internet in theory the right to be forgotten addresses an urgent problem in the digital age it is very hard to escape your past on the internet now that every photo status update and tweet lives forever in the cloud but europeans and americans have diametrically opposed approaches to the problem when commissioner reding announced the new right to be forgotten on january 22 she noted the particular risk to teenagers who might reveal compromising information that they would later come to regret in endorsing the new right reding downplayed its effect on free speech but hendel seems not to have parsed the regulations that were actually proposed three days later on january 25 in a widely cited blog post last march peter fleischer chief privacy counsel of google notes that the right to be forgotten as discussed in europe often covers three separate categories each of which proposes progressively greater threats to free speech since facebook and other social networking sites already allow me to do this creating a legally enforceable right here is mostly symbolic and entirely unobjectionable as proposed the european right to be forgotten would also usefully put pressure on facebook to abide by its own stated privacy policies by allowing users to confirm that photos and other data have been deleted from its archives after they are removed from public display according to the proposed european right to forget the default answer is almost certainly yes 10 at the very least facebook will have to engage in the kinds of difficult line drawing exercises previously performed by courts for a preview of just how chilling that effect might be consider the fact that the right to be forgotten can be asserted not only against the publisher of content such as facebook or a newspaper but against search engines like google and yahoo that link to the content the spanish data protection authority for example has sued google to force it to delete links to embarrassing newspaper articles that are legal under spanish law 12 and suits against third party intermediaries are also threatening freedom of speech in argentina as the case of virginia da cunha shows nevertheless an argentine judge sided with da cunha and after fining google and yahoo ordered them to remove all sites containing sexual images that contained her name the decision was overturned on appeal on the grounds that google and yahoo could only be held liable if they knew content was defamatory and negligently failed to remove it but there are at least one hundred and thirty similar cases pending in argentine courts demanding removal of photos and user generated content mostly brought by entertainers and models the plaintiffs include the sports illustrated swimsuit model yesica toscanini when a user of yahoo argentina plugs her name into the yahoo search engine the result is a blank page 15 i can demand takedown and the burden once again is on the third party to prove that it falls within the exception for journalistic artistic or literary exception this could transform google for example into a censor in chief for the european union rather than a neutral platform europeans have a long tradition of declaring abstract privacy rights in theory that they fail to enforce in practice and the regulation may be further refined over the next year or so as the european parliament and the council of ministers hammer out the details but in announcing the regulation reding said she wanted it to be ambiguous so that it could accommodate new technologies in the future 16 once the regulation is promulgated moreover it will instantly become law throughout the european union and if the eu withdraws from the safe harbor agreement that is currently in place the european framework could be imposed on us companies doing business in europe as well 17 its hard to imagine that the internet that results will be as free and open as it is now 
facebook lobbying europe on unreasonable and unrealistic privacy law reform  but ec commissioner doesnt sound like shes for turning facebook hasnt exactly had smooth relations with europe in september it had to turn off facial recognition in the eu and then theres the whole europe vs facebook transparency project kicked off by an austrian law student who asked zuck and co to send him everything they had on him  inspiring fellow users to flood facebook with demands for their data but operating conditions for facebook in europe look set to get a whole lot tougher if the european commissions proposals for comprehensive reform of eu data protection law come into full effect in the next few years the proposals were unveiled back in january by eu justice commissioner viviane reding a large plank of the strategy is aimed at harmonizing data protection rules across the eu  which arguably will be a boon to businesses certainly to startups who are unlikely to have the resources to comply with multiple legal regimes across all the different eu member states but the ec also wants to give eu citizens more control over their data including granting people the right to have data that companies and organisations hold on them deleted on request a so called right to be forgotten and a right to have their data ported to another service data holders must also notify service users of serious data breaches  if feasible within 24 hours the new rules will apply to any companies and organisations processing eu citizens data even if they are entirely based outside the eu to enforce the new rules the ec is proposing to strengthen independent national data protection authorities  including giving them the ability to fine companies up to 1 million 127 million or up to 2 percent of their global annual turnover for violating the eu data protection rules little wonder facebook is lobbying the commission hard on key portions of the proposals facebook has a team of lobbyists based in brussels which it confirmed to techcrunch are talking to the ec about the proposed data protection directive the right to be forgotten is an obvious sticking point for the social network which has built a billion dollar business by encouraging people to share their personal data with others speaking yesterday at a conference on digital privacy taking place in london facebooks simon milner director of public policy in the uk and ireland said the right to delete your online data is an important one the right to erasure is a key principle however the right to be forgotten raises many concerns with regard to the right of others to remember and to freedom of expression it is important this can be implemented in practice but as drafted the current proposal risks introducing measures which are both unreasonable and unrealistic in terms of the deletion of data that has been copied onto another service we think this obligation would be unreasonable and simply not feasible for services like facebook and others it would fundamentally change how the internet works weve urged policy makers to consider fully the implications on freedom of expression and finding the right balance on different uses of the internet facebook also provided techcrunch with the following statement the revision of europes data protection framework is an important opportunity to develop regulation that both protects privacy and supports the creation and growth of modern services over the global internet we welcome the move towards more harmonization of data protection laws in the eu which will help create legal certainty and confidence for companies to operate at facebook privacy is at the core of everything that we do throughout the process of developing our products we have dedicated privacy experts working with our engineers to ensure that the products are built taking into account any privacy implications and we recently established a dedicated data protection team in ireland we will continue to work closely with politicians and regulators in the eu in order to share our experience and expertise to contribute to achieving sound privacy regulation and a thriving digital sector giving a speech late last month commissioner reding hinted at some of the corporate kick back the proposals are receiving  but also signalled she is unlikely to be swayed by the facebook and doubtless google lobby  on the question of the possible administrative burden for companies i have made concrete proposals to reduce this further one of our main objectives with the regulation is to greatly simplify the legal environment for eu business and lead to potential savings of around 23 billion eur per year a single set of rules is good for competitiveness good for big business good for smes our goal is certainly not to impose a bigger burden and that is why smes are already exempt from some requirements like having a data protection officer it has never been the commissions intention to apply the same rules to the small hairdresser as to a multinational i have today told member states that the commission is prepared to look at whether this sme exemption could be broadened to other areas and that we can also look to add further flexibility through an approach that takes into account the amount and sensitivity of the data processed but lets be frank we should not fall into the trap of some lobbyists expressing concerns for smes but in fact referring to provisions relevant for large multinational firms an ec spokeswoman told techcrunch that discussions in the european parliament and the council on the directive are progressing well adding the european parliament will publish its report early next year and the irish eu presidency aims to achieve political agreement by the end of its presidency summer 2013 it would take a further two years after the proposals had been adopted for the directive to take effect 
us government still leaning on europe to dilute data protection reform proposals the us government is continuing to lobby brussels to water down plans to reform privacy legislation the european unions executive and legislative bodies are in the process of reforming the regions data protection rules  a long overdue wrangle since current legislation dates back to 1995 when facebook was not even a gleam in 11 year old mark zuckerbergs eye the europe commission proposed new rules last january  setting out its intention to harmonize data protection rules across eu member states by establishing a single national data protection authority and also give citizens more control over their data including granting people the right to have data that companies and organisations hold on them deleted on request a so called right to be forgotten and a right to have their data ported to another service data holders would also have to notify service users of serious data breaches  if feasible within 24 hours other proposals include requirements for companies to have a data protection officer to oversee compliance the new rules would apply to any companies and organisations processing eu citizens data  even if they are entirely based outside the eu to enforce the new rules the ec is proposing to strengthen independent national data protection authorities including giving them the ability to fine companies up to 1 million 127 million or up to 2 percent of their global annual turnover the proposals have now reached the european parliament committee debate stage with draft reports produced by committee rapporteurs last week theres still a way to go before agreement is reached between all 27 eu member states enabling new legislation to be adopted  so there is still time for lobbyists to keep aggitating european digital and civil rights association the edri  has obtained a copy of what is purported to be the latest us government lobby document online here   a document which calls on europe to be more flexible in its approach and warns that the reforms risk stifling innovation and growth and jeopardizing the free flow of information needed to fight crime and terrorism the document warns it goes on to urge that the proposals be revised to ensure that security and commerce are not adversely affected the general thrust of the argument set out in the document is that the us does not want to be beholden to european policy decisions on privacy  favouring interoperability of respective privacy frameworks theres also an implied threat that trade and commerce between the us and europe could suffer if the reforms themselves are not reformed interoperability of our respective privacy regimes is critical to maintaining our extraordinary economic relationship fostering trade and preventing non tariff barriers and unlocking the full potential for our economic innovation and growth the document states we urge the eu to look more toward outcomes that provide meaningful protection for privacy and focus less on formalistic requirements the document which runs to five pages goes on to address specific portions of the proposed eu legislation  arguing that standards developed through voluntary consensus based multi stakeholder processes are a better alternative to regulation where the internet is concerned as they are more flexible and adaptable to a quickly changing technological environment it also argues that user consent for use of personal data need not always be express affirmative consent and that the scope of consent based options that are offered to users should correlate with the scale scope and sensitivity of the personal data that organizations collect use or disclose on the right to be forgotten and the right to erasure the us warns the eu to make modifications to avoid hampering the ability to innovate compete and participate in the global economy for example we suggest that the eu reconsider the feasibility of placing obligations on a data controller for publications made by others after consent is withdrawn it notes going on to voice concerns that rights to freedom of expression might suffer under the current proposals the document also argues that the proposed 24 hours data breach notification law is not a long enough period for organizations to comply  and might also lead to over notifications causing consumers to ignore them or act unnecessarily on erroneous information a very large portion of the document is given over to concerns about the impact of the proposals on the global transfer of data and free flow of information  with the us lobbyists apparently arguing that eu proposals could have disastrous ramifications for regulators law enforcement authorities and litigants in civil cases assuming the document is genuine it suggests the us government is continuing to lobby brussels to dilute its proposals last october techweekeurope reported that the us chamber of commerce was lobbying european politicians to alter the proposed new rules on behalf of the us government adam schlosser senior manager for global regulatory cooperation at the chamber of commerce told the publication it had been engaged in lobbying since march with a taskforce of around 50 staff engaged on the issue some of the biggest concerns are providing flexibility for different business models allowing for compliance with existing legal obligations such as anti fraud both in the eu and in third countries and actually creating a one stop shop that is predictable and consistent across member states schlosser told techweekeurope in october he described progress as incremental adding the business community will need sustained and continued efforts to develop a pragmatic approach that considers how a final regulation can actually work in the real world at the time of writing the us chamber of commerce had not responded to a request for an update on its current position regarding the eu privacy reforms facebook has also been lobbying europe about the reforms  with its own smaller team of lobbyists based in brussels  calling aspects of the proposals such as the right to be forgotten unreasonable and unrealistic but its not just big tech companies that are voicing opposition act  the association for competitive technology  an international non profit associationadvocacy group for startup sized small and medium sized businesses such as mobile software developers  has also been lobbying brussels on aspects of the reform that it believes would have a negative impact on startup businesses in the region the commission views startups as lifeforms that dont communicate with bigger businesses eu spokesman for act greg polad told techcrunch a particular bone of contention for act is that the latest amendments to the proposals  in the european parliament draft committee reports  removed prior exemptions for smes to employ a data protection officer replacing it with an exemption for companies that deal with fewer than 500 data pointssubjects a limit polad describes as ridiculously small another admin and cost burden that smes could face as a result of the proposed legislation is a requirement for a business to pre emptively conduct privacy impact assessments if it deals with certain types of data  an up front cost which polad argues could disuade startups from trying to build their businesses in europe if youre saying to startups you have x y and z costs to think about before you start operating then youre not helping them to enter the market and youre most definitely not helping them to innovate and try and test out and experiment on the market he argues 
proposed eu data protection reform could start a trade war us official says out of the 753 members of the european parliament only a very small number are actively working on data protection reform at the moment eu legislative process from the outside it can be difficult to parse how legislation takes effect in brussels there isnt yet a schoolhouse rock episode on the european union three institutions have to balance with one another to make policy the european commission the european council and the european parliament these groups produce several kinds of rules a directive is a set of guidelines which national legislatures translate into their own law meanwhile a  regulation  is directly applicable to the entirety of the euonce passed it immediately becomes the law of 500 million people the process begins in the european commission the eus executive body which introduces a draft the commissions new data protection regulation draft is now being debated among a main parliamentary committee called civil liberties and justice affairs  pdf  as well as two sub committees the committee on the internal market and consumer protection  pdf  and the committee on industry research and energy  pdf  secondary committees present their opinions to the main committee which in turn puts forward final recommendations to the entire parliament which eventually votes on the bill in a plenary session if the parliament approves this legislation will be put to the council of the european union  which represents each individual member state if the council approves the bill becomes law if not the council will send revisions back to parliament if parliament votes to approve the changes then the bill passes or it can be rejected where the bill dies however parliament can also modify the bills language and send it back to the council for approval which can only be unanimous if the council approves it the bill passes if not a conciliation committee with members from both houses convenes and has 6 weeks to create a reconciled bill at that point both houses must take the new bill for a third reading where it can pass by simple majorityif not then its game over brussels belgiumback in 1998 british comedian eddie izzard quipped on his dress to kill tour that the european union was 500 million people 200 languages no ones got a clue what theyre saying to each other its the cutting edge of politics in a very extraordinarily boring way 15 years on its easy to understand how prescient his words were but after spending two days in the belgian capital its clear that digitally minded officials activists lobbyists and members of the european parliament are focused squarely on what could become a massively important change to the european unions rules concerning data protection whats more they have the attention of american tech firms as well as we reported over a year ago justice commissioner viviane reding of the european commission proposed a  comprehensive reform  to existing data protection law which would regulate how online service companies are allowed to keep information on their customers right now anyone who cares about european tech issues has their eye on this ongoing legislation as it makes its way through various brussels bodies the legislation is not expected to take effect until 2016 and by all accounts lobbying pressure from american government representatives and their corporate allies is intensifying at an unprecedented level as the draft amendments for data protection reform make their way through various committees pushing to strengthen what the european commission has proposed one economic officer in the us foreign service even commented this week google translate that the current reform draft could instigate a trade war with the us some european legislators dont mind the attention with this regulation we really try to impact the us debate jan philip albrecht  a green party member of the european parliament mep from northern germany told ars he hopes that the entire parliament will vote on the reforms before the next european parliamentary election in june 2014 albrecht is the  rapporteur  or parliamentary liaison between his committee on civil liberties justice and home affairs libe and the european commission on this issue albrecht acknowledged that american tech companies like google facebook microsoft apple amazon and others would be among the most directly affected should these new reforms that he has proposed take effect of course reform isnt affecting the us directly but we hope that there would be a debate in the us about if it could be a good example for the us to follow he added in this case a new regulation would offer major improvements over current law the data protection reforms as proposed by the commission would consolidate existing data protection rules would require data breach notification within 24 hours and would include a right to be forgotten allowing citizens to delete their data if there are no legitimate grounds for retaining it at present the data protection reform bill could also make data portability easiermoving data from linkedin to facebookand could impose new fines of between 1 and 4 percent of global revenues for companies that violate the eus rules at present tech companies doing business across the eu must pay attention to the rules in all of the 27 member states soon to be 28 when croatia accedes to the union later this year commissioner reding has stated that allowing companies to deal with the data protection authority in the main eu country where they have their establishment would collectively save businesses around 23 billion 31 billion a year in the case of facebook for example that would be ireland where the company has declared its international headquarters control over personal data jan phillip albrecht a 30 year old german mep is spearheading the lead committee proposal amendments to the data reform legislation this month mep albrecht published his draft response to the commissions proposaland thats certainly ruffled some feathers heres one of the most noteworthy additions that he put forth in his 215 page draft pdf expanding on what the commission had initially proposed the right to the protection of personal data is based on the right of the data subject to exert the control over the personal data that are being processed to this end the data subject should be granted clear and unambiguous rights to the provision of transparent clear and easily understandable information regarding the processing of his or her personal data the right of access rectification and erasure of their personal data the right to data portability and the right to object to profiling moreover the data subject should have also the right to lodge a complaint with regard to the processing of personal data by a controller or processor with the competent data protection authority and to bring legal proceedings in order to enforce his or her rights as well as the right to compensation and damages resulting of an unlawful processing operation or from an action incompatible with this regulation the provisions of this regulation should strengthen clarify guarantee and where appropriate codify those rights beyond his formal response the 30 year old german legislator has endorsed a new petition the  brussels declaration  from civil liberties groups digital rights associations and many of europes technorati we are outraged because we the citizens are now kept in hundreds of databases mostly without our knowledge or consent the petition thunders over 1200 companies specialize in trading our personal data mostly without our knowledge or consent every time we browse the internet over 50 companies now monitor every click mostly without our knowledge or consent we are constantly being categorized and judged by algorithms and then treated according to the perceived value we may or may not bring to business without our knowledge and consent and lobbying is currently replacing european citizens voices and manifest concerns signatories to the petition include groups like bits of freedom netherlands electronic privacy and information center usa european digital rights privacy international uk the chaos computer club germany la quadrature du net france and well known european activists including smri mccarthy iceland and max schrems austria whom ars profiled last year pirate by proxy while it may seem surprising that a green party mep is spearheading the parliamentary response to the data protection reform that doesnt surprise the european parliaments eldest and one of its most respected tech savvy meps christian engstrm  a pirate party member from sweden who was elected to the body in 2009 i would consider albrecht as a pirate he told ars from his brussels office i recognize a pirate when i see one the pirate party  easily europes smartest party on tech issues has had some headway in sweden germany switzerland and a handful of other european states and a little bit in the united states  but it has struggled in recent months as its political novelty seems to have worn off a bit christian engstrm a 52 year old mep was the first member of the pirate party elected to the european parliament cyrus farivar engstrm made the case that the pirate party is in a similar position to where the greens were 40 years agorepresenting a fairly fringe area of policy but pressuring other larger parties to carve out their own position if we want anything to happen the pirates are not going to get a majority in any parliament in the world he observed its sad but its a fact of life if we want positive legislations we want people to copy our ideas but were pirates so copying is good for the moment there are only two pirates engstrm and his 25 year old colleague amelia andersdotter  who is also from sweden out of the entire 753 member bodyless than one percent of the entire eu parliament but engstrm says that being part of the liberal parliamentary group the greens european free alliance  may help their views be heard by a wider audience now were in the green group to adopt the pirate party so were up to 7 percent he said with a grin andersdotter is also causing quite a stir as the youngest member of the entire european parliament plus she has created her own reality web series dubbed  exile6e  named after the section of the parliamentary staff offices where she and her entourage are located separated from engstrm an episode published 11 days ago entitled  data protection  shows andersdotter working the minutiae of legislative lifefrom hand signing documents 224 times to speaking on data protection in the council chambers both andersdotter and engstrm sit on the secondary committees that are consulting on the data protection reform process and seem to have full confidence that their views will be represented as the process advances amelia andersdotter stars as the boss in her own webseries when shes not busy legislating washington fires back established industry has been equally forceful in its opposition erika mann a former 15 year mep also from germany who is now the head of facebooks brussels based policy office told the media earlier this month that her employer was concerned that some aspects of the report do not support a flourishing european digital single market and the reality of innovation on the internet eduardo ustaran  a london based attorney and head of the privacy and information law group at field fisher waterhouse warned recently that as is proposed legislation could mean the end of free online services like facebook and gmail if they werent able to use your data in the way that is profitable or useful for them for advertising purposes then either the user has to pay for it or stop using the service he told zdnet this month but its more than just the industry thats upset american officials are making their voices heard in brussels and other european capitals just 10 days ago stockholm hosted a data protection debate with many speakers from the american government including the chamber of commerce and the american chamber of commerce in the eu and industry officials all of whom are expressing deep concern that brussels may force substantial changes to tech companies business models the stockholm debate was one of 10 other data protection events held across the eu this week john rodgers  an economic officer in the us foreign service spoke in berlin in january 2013 google translate noting that a vast right to delete such personal information was not technically feasible and would pose a huge problem for all globally minded companies most surprisingly rodgers warned that the data protection reform as currently conceived could instigate a trade war according to reporting by the german tech news site heise online  rodgers reminded the crowd that american and european laws have very different standards when it comes to data protection we have the right to privacy in our constitution which however represents no fundamental right to privacy he noted even earlier back in early december 2012 the american ambassador to the european union william kennard expressed concern at a brussels conference that americans and american companies would be adversely affected if proposed eu data protection reforms go through as is both the proposed regulation and the proposed directive address the transfer of personal data to third countries and international organizations providing that an adequacy determination by the commission would be the primary means of efficiently and effectively exchanging data and information he warned as currently drafted the criteria to be considered by the commission in making such an adequacy determination would include comparisons to a european style system of data protection the provisions do not recognize the existence of privacy protection systems that are structured differently but ensure an equally high level of protection and enforcement like those in the united states outside observers say that they are shocked with the level of attention that americans have paid to this legislative process nothing not even acta caused the us to lobby on this scale in brussels said joe mcnamee of european digital rights edri in an e mail to ars what is even more surprising is that demonstrably false arguments are sometimes being used undermining the excellent reputation for professionalism that the us representatives have always had this is damage that wont easily be undone for the moment though the european parliaments digital caucusthrough its pirate green and other membersremain optimistic that their counterparts from other countries and other parties are becoming increasingly aware of their interests in the long run technology wins over politics engstrm said 
she claimed it would eliminate 27 conflicting rules and replace them with one continent wide rule allowing a saving of 19bn a year having a separate law in britain would mean separate layers of complication she said claiming that her exchange of letters with justice secretary chris grayling has been rather like kafka britain is meant to oppose red tape here britain wants a supplementary layer of red tape the uk wants 27 rules  one for each country she told the guardian 
european court opinion favors google in privacy battle berlin  in a victory for google the european unions highest court on tuesday was advised to strike down a spanish regulators demand that the search engine grant citizens a broad digital right to be forgotten including the ability to delete previous arrests and other negative publicity from googles online search results an expert opinion requested by the european court of justice which is based in luxembourg recommended that google not be forced to expunge all links to a 15 year old legal notice published in a spanish newspaper documenting a failure to pay back taxes the recommendation of the courts advocate general niilo jskinen who acted as an official fact finder for the panel may also play a role in negotiations to update the european unions 1995 data protection law which was adopted at the dawn of the broadband era a proposal before the european parliament and the council of ministers the european unions upper chamber would give residents of the 27 nation bloc broader control over the display of personal information including a digital right to be forgotten mr jskinen concluded that although spanish data protection law applied to google which operates a local advertising business targeting spanish citizens google merely collated existing information on the web and was not a controller of information and therefore not the legal entity that must comply with the law in addition mr jskinen said europes 1995 data protection law guaranteed a right to be forgotten only in cases where information was incomplete or inaccurate which was not at issue in the spanish case wishing to eliminate embarrassing information is not reason enough to redact public records via google the court appointed expert concluded the advocate general considers that a subjective preference alone does not amount to a compelling legitimate ground the court said in a statement the 1995 law the court statement said does not entitle a person to restrict or terminate dissemination of personal data that he considers to be harmful or contrary to his interests bill echikson the head of free expression for google in europe the middle east and africa welcomed the advocate generals recommendation which is followed by the full court tribunal in three quarters of cases the court of justice is expected to make its official ruling which will guide a spanish high court considering the case later this year this is a good opinion for free expression mr echikson said were glad to see it supports our long held view that requiring search engines to suppress legitimate and legal information would amount to censorship javier aparicio a privacy lawyer with the madrid firm of cuatrecasas goncalves pereira said the courts recommendation would compel the spanish data regulator the agencia espaola de proteccin de datos to end its practice of attempting to force google to redact its own search results to suit the desires of spanish citizens the regulator did not comment after the courts recommendation the lead parliamentary committee in brussels considering the bill to update the 1995 european data protection law has delayed until after the summer a vote on more than 4000 amendments the proposal would give european union citizens the right to take their personal data including photos and texts with them so to speak when they switched to new social networks requiring the former networks to delete their old data upon request the spanish case attempted to give citizens the right to delete embarrassing information from search engines mr aparicio said in an interview the european legislation focuses on social networks i dont think the one will affect the other spain had been particularly aggressive in enforcing portions of the 1995 laws prohibition against storing data on criminal and administrative infractions on individuals over the past five years the spanish data protection regulator the agencia espaola de proteccin de datos has filed 180 requests with google on behalf of spanish citizens asking for the deletion of links to criminal convictions administrative sanctions involvement in child custody disputes and arrests where charges were later dropped most involved publication of past offenses in 2008 a spanish prison guard asked google to expunge a link to a disciplinary sanction against him in a government journal arguing that publication could make him a target of the basque terror group eta a man convicted of damaging a public monument who paid a fine and under spanish law had the misdemeanor deleted from his criminal record asked google in 2009 to eliminate links to his original arrest spanish law gives individuals a broad right to limit the indiscriminate dissemination of personal data even when the original publication was legitimate if the information no longer has relevance or public interest according to a statement by the regulator which is based in madrid google has challenged the requests in spanish court arguing that it provides digital links only to information already in the spanish public domain in addition google has said that the 1995 european laws exemption of platforms included web services like the google search engine which is the market leader in spain the test case before the european judicial panel involved a spaniard who was not identified by the court who wanted google to eliminate all links to a 1998 legal notice in a barcelona newspaper la vanguardia with details of a government auction of his property for failure to pay back taxes one of spains top courts in madrid the audienca nacional asked the european court last year for guidance on how to apply the 1995 law 
eu court advised google does not have to delete personal data from search index not subject to privacy requirements under eu data protection law 
european courts expert argues in googles favour on search results reporters without borders welcomes european court of justice advocate general niilo jskinens findings published today in a legal wrangle between google and a spanish citizen mario costeja over his desire to have certain links expunged from the results of a google search for his name costeja filed a complaint with the spanish data protection agency aepd against google and the newspaper la vanguardia in march 2012 after discovering that a search for his name yielded links to legal notices in the newspaper about the auction of real estate property seized from him for non payment of social security contributions the aepd rejected costejas complaint against the newspaper on the grounds that publication of the information was legal and was protected by the right to information but with extraordinary inconsistency upheld his complaint against google ordering the search engine to eliminate about 100 links from all future searches for costejas name refusing to comply google appealed to the european court of justice produced by the advocate general at the courts request the expert report finds that google is not responsible for personal data in the web pages to which its search results refer and that data protection agencies cannot demand the withdrawal of links from search engine results unless a publisher has included exclusion codes jskinens report also finds that the european directive on data protection does not establish a right to be forgotten and that such a right cannot be used in an attempt to get search engines to suppress information advocate general jskinens analysis and conclusions constitute a significant logical and coherent advance in the protection of online freedom of information reporters without borders said the spanish agencys paradoxical decision which we already condemned in february represented a potential danger to media freedom that has just been partially dispelled we will await the european court of justices final decision in this case for which a date has not yet been set we hope that this decision will finally convince the spanish data protection agency and all other similar european agencies not to confuse the necessary protection of privacy with the so called right to be forgotten which is the subject of growing interest on the part of many people and poses a serious threat to our right to information trying to rewrite history by suppressing web links or web archives is a pandoras box that is best not opened we strongly urge the european commission which is currently examining this issue to heed advocate general jskinens conclusions 

reading reding pouring water on dp draft bill its been a busy few days for the future of data protection at a european level however the celebrations and commiserations are well and truly over for policy wonks internet businesses and watchdogs who have all been eagerly poring over the justice commissioners freshly tabled draft data protection dp bill now the real work begins late last week i was one among hundreds of attendees at the computers privacy  data protection conference  an event that is fast becoming an essential annual meeting point for anyone wanting to dissect the latest online privacy issues the brussels shindig for dp geeks has actually been going for a good few years now but this one  cast at the same time as reding putting forward her draft data protection bill  was arguably the most important yet if nothing else it certainly served as an immediate post mortem thats because the commissioners proposals are still being digested by the various national data protection authorities throughout europe some are spitting blood over the far reaching changes detailed within the planned directive while others complain that it simply hasnt gone far enough well to be blunt inevitably given its lax history on data protection the uk government is one of the most vocal of the 27 member states against some of the proposed rules put forward by the ecs vice president one of the areas of major concern according to blightys under secretary of state at the ministry of justice crispin blunt is redings notion of the right to be forgotten online he was talking on behalf of the council of europe whose job it now is to scrutinise the proposed overhaul to the treaty for the overly wordy protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data otherwise known as convention 108 the original text for that concord was agreed in 1981 and served as something of a model for the eus 1995 directive on data protection like redings proposed rewrite of europes dp law convention 108 also needs to be modernised to fall into step with the technology used today to handle data processing especially online in the current environment of cloud computing social networking and other forms of new technology individuals in both europe and beyond want to be confident that their privacy safety and freedoms are strongly protected blunt said he opined that dp laws developed in the uk 30 years ago remained relevant today but admitted that some points needed to be revisited simply imposing detailed prescription is unlikely to make our citizens feel safer or freer in fact such a regulatory straight jacket runs the risk of doing the opposite and tying the hands of individuals who seek to protect us from harm blunt said we should look to better understand each other and our respective laws rather than unpicking enduring principles and introducing an entirely new and quite possibly impractical regulatory framework the minister added that redings right to be forgotten pledge was an area where he would like to sound a note of caution he said that it seemed to him at first glance to be wholly commendable but added that policymakers needed to take a long hard look at how they planned to make such a proposal workable he argued that such a move in the current shaky european economy could potentially be badly timed businesses might be hampered by such legislation blunt countered blunt also questioned how the transfer of so much data online could be realistically dealt with by businesses such as google that will be told  if the draft bill passes in its current form  to notify at dpa within 24 hours of a data breach taking place my concern is we may be running the risk of setting the standard so high that we are unlikely ever to achieve a workable model he said the uk government is well known for being something of an agitator on the data protection scene in part because it has such disdain for the one size fits all proposed law as reding told me last summer the british point of view to open the internal market has not changed 
on californias bizarre internet eraser law for teenagers california has passed a well intentioned law allowing teens to scrub their youthful indiscretions from the internet starting in 2015 any minor can request that a digital service provider delete pictures of themselves passed out drunk at a justin bieber concert the law doesnt make a whole lot of sense since nearly every imaginable service offers a delete button perhaps more importantly it ignores the reality that its nearly impossible to delete information from the net embarrassing photos spread virally and internet archives automatically create copies of nearly every piece of information on the web yet as written it appears to create a head on collision between privacy law and the first amendment there are no clear rules on what will survive when a friend comments or interacts with a given piece of regrettable content that will inevitably end up being deleted the web is chaotic viral and interconnected either the law is completely toothless or it sets in motion a very scary anti information snowball the law as written california sb 658 requires the operator of an internet web site online service online application or mobile application to permit a minor who is a registered user of the operators internet web site online service online application or mobile application to remove or to request and obtain removal of content or information posted the law kicks in on january 1st just in time for hung over minors to delete their new years eve shenanigans it also prohibits websites from targeting minors with a host of fun yet regrettable products such as e cigarettes and tattoos not realistic if a vengeful ex boyfriend shares a naughty picture of his former lover with the facebook universe sb 658 doesnt give a minor the right to erase it users can only delete data they upload also if a teenage mother posts a picture of her toddler toking weed out of a bong thats also exempt law enforcement can subpoena the information perhaps most importantly more and more of the social media world is automatically archived the sunlight foundation for instance automatically archives tweets in case a politician deletes one some deleted tweets are pretty hilarious on top of all this nearly every website imaginable permits users to delete a post so in reality the law is completely unrealisticunnecessary still james steyer chief executive of child advocacy group common sense media calls the law a very important milestone 4th vs 1st amendment as written the law is about giving a specific group prone to stupid decisions the ability to delete information they dont like in this in comes dangerously close to the european unions proposed  right to be forgotten  the right to be forgotten could make facebook and google for example liable for up to two percent of their global income if they fail to remove photos that people post about themselves and later regret even if the photos have been widely distributed already explains jeffrey rosen a law professor at george washington university while sb 658 attempts to restrain court orders to information that hasnt been reposted by other users its not clear how that would work in practice if for instance i like a photo of my friend at a strip club but he later wants it erased what should happen facebook likes are now protected as first amendment speech to have any sort of teeth the law will eventually have to permit the erasure of data that has been reposted archived or interacted with and as a result must create a grow a whole new body of case law dedicated to choosing when the right to be forgotten trumps our right to share and discuss information the french have already made their decision on this matter  le droit  loubli or the right of obliviona right that allows a convicted criminal who has served his time and been rehabilitated to object to the publication of the facts of his conviction and incarceration explains rosen if eu proposals go through this type of censorship will extend to the internet realistically the only thing sb 658 did was open up a can of worms on the right to erase information from the internet from here things are only going to get more bizarre 
qa on eu data protection reform before the civil liberties committee vote parliaments political groups negotiated a set of amendments covering many elements of both files in order to achieve a strong mandate for negotiations with the council and reduce the number of amendments put to a vote here is an overview of some of the committees key proposals for the regulation data transfers to non eu countries article 43a the rules voted in committee govern transfers of personal data to third countries if a third country asks a firm eg a search engine social network or cloud provider to disclose personal data processed in the eu the firm would have to get permission from the national data protection authority and inform the person concerned before transferring any data penalties for companies article 79 for those breaking the rules data protection authorities would have to impose at least one of these penalties say meps a written warning in the event of less serious breaches regular periodic data protection audit or for companies a fine up to 100 million or 5 of annual worldwide turnover whichever is greater the commission proposed up to 1 million or 2 of annual worldwide turnover when imposing these penalties the data protection authorities would have to take into account aggravating factors such as the duration of the breach its negligent or repetitive character willingness to cooperate and the amount of damage done right to erasure article 17 according to parliaments mandate any person data subject should have the right to have their personal data erased when a the data processing does not comply with eu rules b the data are no longer necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or c the person objects or withdraws hisher consent for the processing of hisher personal data furthermore to enforce this right if a person asks an internet company to erase hisher data the company should also forward the request to others which replicate the data this right to erasure builds upon what is outlined in the 1995 directive and the commission proposal however this right would be restricted in some cases for instance when the data are needed for historical statistical and scientific research purposes for public health reasons or to exercise the right to freedom of expression also the right to erasure would not apply when the retention of personal data is necessary to fulfill a contract or is required by law the right to erasure would cover the right to be forgotten as proposed by the commission explicit consent article 7 where processing is based on consent a company could process personal data only after obtaining clear permission from the data subject who could withdraw hisher consent at any time a persons consent means any freely given specific informed and explicit indication of hisher wishes either by a statement or by a clear affirmative action civil liberties meps retained this proposal they also stipulate that the execution of a contract or the provision of a service cannot be made conditional upon consent to processing personal data that is not strictly needed for the completion of that contract or service furthermore according to parliaments position the consent loses its effect as soon as the processing of personal data is no longer needed for the initial purpose for which they were collected meps also stiuplate that withdrawing consent must be as easy as giving it clear and plain language right to information to make it easier for people to give their informed consent data controllers should use clear concise plain language when explaining their privacy policies and especially when providing any information addressed specifically to a child meps say article 11 when collecting personal data the controller should explain to the data subject whether hisher personal information will be transferred to commercial third parties sold rented out or encrypted they should also state whether the personal data are being collected andor will be retained beyond the minimum time needed for the specific purpose of the processing or for different purposes this should be done using easily understandable texts and symbols meps add article 13a the data controller would also be required to inform the person about various aspects of the data processing such as the period of storage the recipients of the personal data and the possible existence of profiling as well as the data subjects rights of access rectification and erasure of the data and to lodge a complaint with a data protection authority article 14 profiling article 20 the proposal sets limits to profiling a technique used to analyse or predict a persons performance at work economic situation location health preferences reliability or behaviour based on the automated processing of hisher personal data meps proposed changes point out that profiling as a general rule would only be allowed with the consent of the person concerned where permitted by law or when needed to pursue a contract they also clarify that profiling should not lead to discrimination or be based solely on sensitive data ie data revealing inter alia ethnic origin political opinions religion sexual orientation genetic or biometric data administrative sanctions or suspected offences the civil liberties committee also makes it clear that profiling should not be based solely on automated processing and should comprise human assessment including an explanation of the decision reached after such an assessment this could affect the way in which creditworthiness is evaluated for example data portability under the commission proposal any person would have the right to ask eg an email service provider or a social network to provide a copy of all hisher data in an electronic commonly used format to be transferred to another provider or service so called right to data portability article 18 civil liberties committee meps propose merging the right to data portability with the right to data access article 15 and stress that for personal information processed by electronic means the controller should provide a copy of these data in an electronic and interoperable format this would allow users to switch email providers without losing contacts or previous emails for instance where technically feasible and at the request of the data subject the data would be transferred directly from controller to controller eg from email provider to email provider data protection officer article 35 public institutions companies processing the data of more than 5000 people in a year and organisations whose core activities involve processing sensitive data or systematically monitoring people would be required to appoint a data protection officer dpo this proposal is based on the german model meps amendments change the criteria for appointing a dpo so the criterion would be not how many employees a company has the commission suggested at least 250 but rather how many peoples data it collects also dpos should be appointed for at least four years in the case of employees and two in that of external contractors the european commission proposed two years in both cases dpos should be in a position to perform their duties independently and enjoy special protection against dismissal says the civil liberties committee right to complain article 54a under meps amendments those persons whose personal data are processed by a controller eg an internet company in another eu member state should be able to complain to the data protection authority of hisher choice that of the country where the company is based or the one in hisher own country this should make it easier for citizens to lodge complaints in their own language stronger and more independent data protection authorities in line with article 16 of the eu treaty and with the case law of the court of justice of the eu meps reinforce the independence of the data protection authorities dpas and clarify their powers of intervention one stop shop and consistency mechanism a key innovation of the regulation is that it sets a single competent authority for all processing activities of a data controller or processor in the eu the dpa of the country where the controller has its main establishment will have the lead when it comes to taking measures with regard to that controller the dpa will consult other national data protection authorities involved eg that of the citizen lodging a complaint this will have an impact on the oversight of internet giants with offices in several eu countries in the event of disagreement there will be a consistency mechanism in which the european data protection board a body that will coordinate dpas will be involved 
britain seeks opt out of new european social media privacy laws britain is attempting to opt out of a european initiative enabling anyone to delete their personal details from online service providers  a power known as the right to be forgotten the clash between brussels and the ministry of justice has erupted in the final stages of negotiations over the eus general data protection regulation which aims to rebalance the relationship between the individual and the internet the debate reflects growing tensions between freedom of expression and privacy as increasing numbers of people complain that their online reputation is being corroded by outdated inaccurate or malicious information that cannot be removed in france the number of complaints concerning the right to be forgotten rose 42 last year a guardian project has unearthed hundreds of cases of people alarmed at the mishandling of their data or personal information the uks chief objection to the eu move is that unrealistic expectations will be created by the rights expansive title because the controls proposed will be relatively modest in their impact on the way data spreads or is traded across websites the right to be forgotten article 17 of the data protection regulation has been developed by the eu justice commissioners office primarily in response to complaints about the way social media  such as facebook retain and handle information although the terms of the regulation have not yet been finalised its current form provides for punitive fines  up to 2 of global turnover  for companies that refuse to comply with requests to erase customers personal details viviane reding the eu justice commissioner said at present a citizen can request deletion only if data is incomplete or incorrect we want to extend this right to make it stronger in this internet world the burden of proof shall be on the companies they will have to show that data is needed this piece of legislation is one of the biggest market openers of the last few years it eliminates 27 conflicting rules one for each eu state and replaces them with a mechanism for the whole continent this means saving 23bn 19bn a year but the british government have asked us not to do this and would prefer two laws one for britain and one for other people meaning there would be separate layers of complication i have exchanged letters with the uk justice secretary chris grayling on this which is rather like kafka britain is meant to oppose red tape here britain wants a supplementary layer of red tape its crazy the uk wants 27 rules  one for each country in a letter to grayling dated 8 march reding wrote you raise the possibility of specific rules for smes small and medium sized enterprises which operate nationally rather than cross border i am surprised to learn that it would be the intention of the uk to introduce a new layer of complexity cost and risk of non compliance by having one set of obligations for domestic operations and one for cross border operations the uk is lobbying for the changes to be part of a directive which would give the government more flexibility about how it is adopted rather than being contained in a more prescriptive internal market regulation reding who is from luxembourg and also a vice president of the european commission stressed the new right to be forgotten would not be absolute and would be assessed in relation to other rights such as freedom of expression retention of medical records or data for tax purposes it would for example permit students who post embarrassing pictures of themselves on social media sites to remove them at a later date if those images had spread to a third party however the right of removal would be significantly diluted the site that initially held them would be required to contact other sites to which it is linked informing them that a request had been made to erase information there will be no power to remove it from third parties but if a company has given it to another firm without asking if they can sell it then the individuals rights will be re enforced the right will not apply to journalistic archives comments on articles or posts by bloggers who will be exempted on the grounds of freedom of expression material posted by other people  friends or antagonists  would also remain unaffected there is an exemption in data protection regulations for material of a personal or household nature reding added the european rules will apply to every company  which operates in the internal market the eu is a large market with 500 million citizens if you want to take advantage of this goldmine then apply the rules facebook and such providers like the one stop shop they like the fact that the rules are the same everywhere theres no opt out this is an internal market regulation its a decision that will be taken by majority rule the case of the austrian law student max schems who battled facebook for months to recover his personal data and eventually received 1222 pages of material in 2011 is emblematic of the problems reding believes need addressing facebook subsequently altered its data retention policies as a result of the case ireland where google and facebooks european headquarters are based holds the presidency of the eu it has said that enacting the data protection regulation is a key priority for its presidency which ends in june the uks information commissioners office agrees that the new regulation will shift the balance between consumers and data controllers but it cautions our concern is about how difficult or impossible this may be to achieve in practice and how it could lead individuals to believe falsely that they can achieve the absolute erasure of information about them we know from the efforts of well resourced and motivated individuals that it can in fact be impossible to remove information from the internet once it has been posted we are concerned that this right as billed could mislead individuals as to the degree of protection the law can offer them in practice the london based lobby group privacy international is similarly sceptical anna fielder one of the organisations trustees said we think the right to erasure is essential and thats likely to stay the right to delete your information once you have left a service provider if you left a bank you wouldnt like them to keep your data for ever but its no more than a right to delete your data its got so many exceptions its specifically targeted at facebook users for example photos of drunken teenagers facebook should try and make all the people who have shared the data remove it as well but its not a compulsion it has so many exceptions freedom of expression public interest in public health and scientific research the moj said the uk does not support the right to be forgotten as proposed by the european commission the title raises unrealistic and unfair expectations of the proposals we are also concerned about potentially impossible requirements for data controllers to manage third party erasure the reasonable steps required by the draft regulation would promise much but deliver little stewart room a privacy specialist at the law firm field fisher waterhouse said article 17 covers where consent is withdrawn for information being held this is intended to address the idea that a kid may stick something on facebook and later on there should be a way of taking it down in silicon valley theres a lot of venture capital going into tech companies that can achieve erasure of data theres a lot of demand in the market for cleansing online information richard allan facebooks director of policy for europe middle east and africa said the core concept that you as a data subject should be able to delete your personal data is absolutely reasonable its something we implement on our service but we have concerns about about the workability and consequences of a mechanism where organisations start sending each other instructions about data that needs to be removed our worry is that it will take up resources and wont be effective individuals he said should approach data controllers directly to ask for material to be removed facebook which has a billion users has a social reporting mechanism that allows users to request that material is taken down from other accounts on the site allan said our users like the mechanism we think the most responsible service providers will offer the right to erasure where people are dealing with irresponsible service providers it may be that the national data protection authorities take action a different legal development that could be equally far reaching emerged in a uk court of appeal judgment this year in the case of tamiz vs google which ruled that in principle the internet search engine may also be a publisher and therefore liable to defamation proceedings for material on a blog hosted on one of its platforms 
privacy matters in internet of things innovation race there is evidence that regulators in the uk and europe are considering the impact of the internet of things but for now businesses must work within the existing legal framework and apply that to changing circumstances the first challenge manufacturers need to think about is whether their product processes personal data ie information that can identify an individual this is not as easy as it appears because this includes data that when combined with other information can identify someone for example a product using a static ip address sending data to a remote server is probably not processing personal data once this product starts connecting to other products and services that in combination can identify an individual the data becomes subject to the legislation in the uk the main impact of this is a requirement to comply with the data protection act and its eight key principles these include requiring that the data is processed fairly and lawfully and is only used for the original purpose it was obtained the data should also be kept secure and should not be transferred outside the european economic area unless there is adequate protection given to any personal data if the connected device is collecting sensitive personal data such as medical information then the rules are even more stringent in addition to the data protection act companies need to be aware of the privacy and electronic communications regulations which establish additional provisions in relation to marketing and advertising by electronic means the key issue here is the need to obtain clear and specific consent for marketing communications for example through the use of a tick box the existing data protection regime is due to be updated via the european data protection regulation currently working its way through the legislative process perhaps the most interesting aspect of this for the internet of things is the proposed right to be forgotten which the uk has sought to opt out of this has been introduced as a response to concerns about social media networks but would be equally applicable to products collecting personal data if it came into force this would require manufacturers to establish processes for erasing the data collected by their products to respond to privacy issues product manufacturers will need to think differently in two key areas firstly they must think about how they design their products and their support processes to take account of potential data privacy issues this should be part of the initial design process to avoid expensive re work of product design or potential product recall issues manufacturing companies will also need to consider the relationships they have with their consumers both in terms of the sales process and ongoing support privacy notices will need to incorporated into the pre sales process and it may be necessary to establish an online aftersales system which allows consumers who have bought the product to alter their privacy settings as and when they wish the privacy challenge posed by the internet of things is by no means insurmountable but as iot ready products become more common place businesses will need to adjust to new responsibilities or face significant brand damage and large fines

both for and against the takedown technology is not purely a boon but comes with its own attendant problems recognising this complex reality the guardian has a dedicated section called internet privacy  the right to be forgotten to discuss the issues involved in a dispassionate manner the primary argument here is the internet has a long memory but what if the pictures data and personal information that it can pull up about you appear unfair one sided or just plain wrong more and more people are claiming they have a right to be forgotten and are even trying to delete themselves from the web the issue appears poised to generate legal technological and moral wranglings for years to come the session on unpublishing led by david jordan director editorial policy and standards british broadcasting corporation managed to capture some of the real challenges in dealing with the request for removing content from the web archive the principles for web archiving of media organisations according to david jordan are material published online will be part of a permanently accessible archive the archive of online content is a matter of public record and its existence is in the public interest material will not normally be removed or we risk erasing the past and altering history and online content  whether part of a catch up service or a permanent archive  should only be removed or amended in exceptional circumstances risks after removal before removing any online content mr jordan alerted us that we must consider the potential harm such an action can do to the public interest and the integrity of the archive or catch up service he said there is a risk with removal that we simply create suspicion about what else is missing and fuel conspiracy theories about its absence we also need to consider the risk that information we remove may take on a life of its own and become distorted in the retelling in the absence of the original content it will be harder to refute inaccurate accounts of our content some of the participants also raised the question of the internet cache that keeps some of the content widely in circulation and that in these cases removal from one site may simply be ineffective the questions that came up for discussion were can things be done which fall short of removal should the public record always be sacrosanct do we have a duty to ensure that the public record is complete  eg an accurate report of arrest and chargetrial but no report of acquittal can steps short of removal solve the problem without compromising the record two cases mr jordan among other things discussed two specific cases that may interest the readers of this newspaper the first is a case of a law student charged in connection with a prank about a bomb threat in a public place all charges against the law student were dropped well before the case went to trial his lawyer said he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time a year later the student requests that reports of the charges be removed from the online archive he is job hunting and concerned that because searches of his name in google pull up those articles he will be stigmatised the second is a request from an iranian political activist about his interview to the bbc i gave two interviews to the bbc website and my name is printed there as you may know political relations between iran and the uk is tremendously worsening and the iranian administration has passed a law that makes interviews with foreign media illegal and there could be severe consequences for any violation currently i reside in the us but i plan to visit iran pretty soon and these interviews may be really troublesome i would like to know if there is any possibility that my name and photo can be modified to anonymous due to security reasons the longtail of news to unpublish or not to unpublish a paper by kathy english public editor of the toronto star  examines how news organisations throughout north america are responding to requests to unpublish news content i propose to create a template for the hindu in consultation with the editor in chief and the editor over the next few months for unpublishing readerseditorthehinducoin

eu court rules against google in data deletion case taking up a complaint concerning a spanish citizen the european court of justice said individuals have this right to be forgotten under certain circumstances when their personal data becomes outdated or inaccurate specifically this applies when such data appear to be inadequate irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive in relation to the purpose for which they were processed and in the light of the time that has elapsed this was based on the finding that under current data protection norms in the european union an internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data there was no immediate response from google but the company which dominates the internet search industry has previously argued that it is responsible only for finding the information as long as this is correct and legal and therefore properly part of the public record it believes it should not be obliged to delete such data which it argues amounts to censorship tuesdays ruling came as a surprise because last year a top ecj lawyer had argued that google was not responsible for the data carried by websites appearing on its search engine and that eu citizens did not have a right to be forgotten in the digital world that opinion had suggested the ecj would rule accordingly in due course the case centres on a spanish national who went to court because the personal details of his involvement in a debt recovery operation continued to appear on the online version of a spanish newspaper long after the legal dispute had been resolved in favour of the plaintiff spains data protection agency the aepd found that the newspaper was not at fault because the information was correct at the time however it upheld the complaint against google asking it to delete the material from its search results when google appealed spain sought guidance from the ecj to resolve the issue european justice commissioner viviane reding proposed in 2012 that a right to be forgotten be included in eu legislation on data protection to meet concerns it was not adequate given the pace of techology change personal data protection has become an even more sensitive issue with revelations of massive us and other intelligence service snooping 
google should erase web links to some personal data europes highest court says google should erase web links to some personal data europes highest court says brussels  the highest european union court decided on tuesday that google must in some cases grant users of its search engine a so called right to be forgotten that includes deletion of links to embarrassing legal records the decision by the european court of justice in luxembourg appeared to represent a blow for google it comes as momentum builds in europe to adopt an even more far reaching privacy law already under negotiation by lawmakers that includes a tougher right to be forgotten or erasure as it is called in draft legislation that also would apply to companies like facebook the judgment on tuesday was based on a data protection law from 1995 that provides limited rights to object to the processing of personal information and to demand its erasure in certain situations the court decided that there were cases in which a company like google should allow online users to be forgotten after a certain time by erasing links to web pages unless there are particular reasons such as the role played by the data subject in public life justifying a preponderant interest of the public it ruled that companies like google could be obliged to remove links to web pages even when the original publication in itself on those pages is lawful according to a summary of the judgment and in what appeared to be an endorsement of the aggressive approach to privacy protection in europe in the digital age the court said in its summary that the effect of the interference with the persons rights is heightened on account of the important role played by the internet and search engines in modern society favoring companies like google in such circumstances could not be justified by merely the economic interest which the operator of the engine has in the data processing the court said the case began in 2009 when mario costeja a lawyer objected that entering his name in googles search engine led to legal notices dating back to 1998 in an online version of a spanish newspaper that detailed his accumulated debts and the forced sale of his property mr costeja said that the debt issues had been resolved many years earlier and were no longer relevant when the newspaper that had published the information la vanguardia refused to remove the notices and when google refused to expunge the links mr costeja complained to the spanish data protection agency that his rights to the protection of his personal data were being violated the spanish authority ordered google to remove the links in july 2010 but it did not impose any order on la vanguardia google challenged the order and the national high court of spain referred the case to the european court for advice on how to rule the judgment on tuesday follows a preliminary victory for google in june 2013 when an adviser to the court niilo jaaskinen decided that google did not need to remove the links mr jaaskinen concluded that because google merely aggregated information on the web and was not a controller of information it was not the legal entity that must comply with the provision of the law in question mr jaaskinen also said that the 1995 law guaranteed a right to be forgotten only in cases where information was incomplete or inaccurate which was not at issue in the spanish case
